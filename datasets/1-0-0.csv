La prise en charge globale d’un patient affecté d’un lupus érythémateux systémique doit tenir compte des comorbidités fréquemment associées, et ce, d’autant plus que le patient est le plus souvent sous corticoïdes à long terme et immunosuppresseurs. Il convient donc, au cours du suivi, de :

cibler les complications cardiovasculaires ;
mettre à jour les vaccins, si possible avant l’instauration du traitement immunosuppresseur ;
rechercher une éventuelle fragilité osseuse ;
dépister l’apparition d’une néoplasie (lymphome, carcinome cutané, cancer du poumon ou du col de l’utérus).

While the Raspberry Pi project has its origins in education, the majority of Raspberry Pi computers we make today are destined for industrial and embedded applications. To address these applications, our products need to perform flawlessly in harsh environments – subject to extremes of temperature or pressure, or running unattended for years on end in remote or inaccessible locations.

Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 has been used successfully by thousands of embedded customers in a wide variety of challenging environments. But there are geographical locations where outdoor winter temperatures fall below the -20°C minimum operating temperature specified for Compute Module 4, and certain indoor applications also require correct operation at very low temperatures.

To support our customers in designing products for these demanding conditions, today we are announcing several new Compute Module 4 variants, with an extended operating temperature range of -40°C to +85°C. These variants integrate extended-temperature-range SDRAM and eMMC parts from our partner Samsung; all other components on the board are already qualified to the broader temperature range.","For industry

It was written by Senani Dehigolla (Regions Refocus), Erica Levenson (Regions Refocus), Anita Nayar (Regions Refocus), Nela Porobić (WILPF), and Fatimah Kelleher (Nawi–Afrifem Macroeconomics Collective).

I am founder and CEO of Dealcode. Dealcode is an AI guided Selling Software for B2B and SaaS sales teams. This is why I have a kind of 24/7 job, which is actually the best thing I can imagine. As a founder, you have to keep several balls in the air at the same time. One moment you're dealing with the future of the product, then you have to take care of recruiting and conducting interviews and in the next meeting you're talking to investors and have to report numbers. That keeps your brain busy and is also what I am passionate about. I love the versatility of my role.","AI Agent Lead Search

After years of big talk about how AI would transform software development, many of the boldest claims have yet to materialize. Modern generative AI tools have been around for over four years, but some of the most important questions remain. Are they actually making developers more productive? Are they replacing roles or simply changing how the work gets done?

There is no simple answer.

Adoption continues to grow. More than half of developers have used AI tools in some way. Yet, many of the companies making the strongest statements about AI-written code are still hiring engineers. In parallel, some metrics suggest that code quality has either stagnated or, in some cases, declined.",AdChoicesPrivacy StatementYour Privacy ChoicesCookie PreferencesDigital Terms of SaleTerms of ServiceContact UsSend Us FeedbackReport a Security IssueJobs At ForbesReprints & PermissionsForbes Press RoomAdvertise,

Why write this?

Why write this content?
Hi

My name is Xu Zhewei. I founded Yide Information Co., Ltd. in 2015 , providing WordPress website building, hosting, and teaching services. Over this period of time, I have assisted in the creation of hundreds of WordPress website projects of various sizes.

I have the habit of writing work notes, but I have a bad habit of organizing them. There are quite a lot of unorganized information and solutions to various magical problems on Notion. After a long time, I can hardly find what I want to find, and I even forget why I wrote some of them down.

This is a bit troubling, so I wanted to take this opportunity to categorize and organize these contents on Gitbook, rather than simply copying the information from Notion to Gitbook. I will modify and polish it so that at least I can understand it.","Preface

So off the bat, I know we are seeing broad based inflation. The dollar is worth about 10% less compared to January of this year. The still, bond yields are down, crypto is up, gold is up AND stocks are roaring? During a government shutdown? With the economic numbers being shaky at best and every industry I hear of from construction to filmmaking is sputtering. Like what is actually going on? I'm willing to entertain any crazy theory as long as it's backed up by something cuz right now shit just does not make sense

2024-03-30 20:35:10 27点赞 28收藏 14评论
买投影有哪些坑，简述10个
买投影不像买电视，买电视关注尺寸与价位区分档次基本就大差不差，买回去不管摆在哪里，亮度和画质都一样。

投影相比电视要更复杂，稍有不慎，你就容易被误导买到不符合预期的投影，最后只能勉强接受或者浪费钱财直接吃灰。

《投影仪行业大揭秘》！网红和杂牌投影不会告诉你的20个坑，24年再买投影必看避雷指南！附型号推荐
1·警惕不正规店铺和杂牌，1LCD投影仪门槛太低，数百个杂牌入局赚快钱！大多数画质不堪入目，其次是没有长久的系统运营与售后，产品也不指望做回头客。哪些品牌值得信赖，其实去看其母公司是否做过中高档DLP，3LCD投影，如果有那么至少有技术积淀。

有个技巧，购买时请先去京东看它有没有旗舰店，其次我给你列下当前可以买至少不会跑路的品牌：极米，爱普生，当贝，坚果，海信，峰米，优派，大眼橙，明基，NEC，奥图码，腾讯极光，索尼，巴克，慧示，联想，长虹，小米，小明，哈趣，快乐星球，微果，知麻，酷开（不完全统计）。""","首页

38,https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/mathematics/perimeter-and-circumference,"Perimeter and circumference
Perimeter and circumference are two fundamental concepts in geometry related to length measurements. The perimeter of a geometric figure refers to the total distance around its boundary, while circumference specifically pertains to the perimeter of a circle. The term ""perimeter"" comes from Greek, where ""peri"" means ""around"" and ""meter"" means ""measure."" For example, the perimeter of a square can be calculated as four times the length of one side. Circumference is calculated using the formula \(C = 2\pi r\), where \(r\) represents the radius of the circle.

Throughout history, the study of perimeter and circumference has played a crucial role in various mathematical developments. Notably, ancient mathematicians like Archimedes and Eratosthenes made significant contributions to understanding these concepts, such as calculating the Earth's circumference using geometry and trigonometry. The circumference of a circle is also relevant in practical applications, including health measurements like waist circumference, which can indicate health risks. Overall, both perimeter and circumference are key tools in mathematics that have applications in real-world scenarios, from construction to health and environmental studies.","On This Page

Résumé
Textes
Le tribunal de commerce constitue une juridiction d'exception, destinée à connaître des contestations en matière commerciale et à assurer la police des commerçants (immatriculation au registre du commerce et des sociétés, dont il assure, via le greffe, la tenue, les modifications et la radiation du registre du commerce et des sociétés, la surveillance des divers registres où sont inscrits les nantissements, les protêts, etc. et généralement tout ce qui concerne la vie juridique professionnelle des commerçants).
Historique
L'idée d'une juridiction propre aux commerçants est née au Moyen Âge, spécialement dans les villes de foire. Toutefois, la création du premier véritable tribunal de commerce a eu lieu à Paris, grâce à un édit pris par le roi Charles IX en 1563. Cet édit a établi dans la capitale une juridiction consulaire composée d'un juge et de plusieurs consuls, marchands élus par leurs pairs.

Activité partielle et jours fériés
15 mai 2020 Carole Vercheyre-Grard 2 commentaires
Beaucoup d’entre vous m’interrogent sur les règles d’indemnisation des jours fériés en période d’activité partielle des salariés.

Les conditions de l’indemnisation de ces jours fériés pendant la période d’activité partielle dépendent d’un critère :

Ce jour était-il habituellement chômé ou travaillé dans l’entreprise ?

 

Jour férié habituellement chômé dans l’entreprise : maintien du salaire
Si le jour férié est habituellement chômé dans l’entreprise, ce jour ne sera pas indemnisé au titre de l’activité partielle mais payé par l’entreprise dans les conditions prévues par le Code du travail et la loi.

Pour mémoire, selon les articles L. 3133-3 et L. 3133-5 du code du travail :

Pour le 1er mai tout salarié a droit à une indemnité égale au salaire perdu
Pour les autres jours fériés, les salariés qui bénéficient d’une ancienneté d’au moins 3 mois dans l’entreprise ont droit à un maintien de salaire. Cette condition d’ancienneté est supprimée dans de nombreuses conventions collectives.
Le maintien de salaire devra se faire à hauteur de l’indemnité de chômage partiel, soit 70 % de la rémunération brute (84% du net).

L’employeur devra déduire de sa demande d’indemnisation les heures correspondants au jour férié de chaque salarié. Il ne percevra pas l’allocation d’activité partielle versée par l’État","Carole Vercheyre-Grard

Hi Munawir,

The task is scheduled for this month, but since we have already released the 2022.3.4-rc.1 I’m not 100% it will make it to this release, but probably 22.3.5. The developer assigned to the task will give you an update here when it’s fixed, as promised.

Cheers, Mia

@mia.arh I’ve tried it on 2022.3.4 and still exists, so it appears it will be included in the next release

in addition to that bug, there is also a new one which is export to timezone button
it won’t convert to the correct timezone

I wanna report this to give you more context on the export functionality bugs
thanks

Exploring the Deep-Seated Links Between Trauma and Women's Chronic Illness


Unraveling Women's Health: The Trauma Connection
Women's health is woven with stories of resilience, often shrouded in the silent impact of emotional and physical trauma. Emerging research underscores a compelling connection between trauma and chronic health conditions, with a specific focus on its influence in female populations. This exploration delves into the myriad ways trauma, particularly from childhood experiences and interpersonal violence, manifests into long-standing health issues, encompassing mental, physical, and socio-economic dimensions. Understanding these connections not only sheds light on the health challenges faced by millions of women but also highlights the pathways necessary for fostering holistic healing.","About us

As an Enclave user, this has two main implications for you:



When creating a new Shared-Tenancy Environment, you can now pick from a selection of eligible Shared-Tenancy Stacks. For example, you can now deploy in us-west-1 (N. California) or eu-central-1 (Frankfurt).

When creating a new Dedicated-Tenancy Environment, you no longer need to wait for us to activate your Environment after creating it. Instead, your Environment automatically activates, and you can start using it right away.



As part of this change, we’ve also upgraded the Dashboard sidebar to show you not only your Environments, but also the Stacks they’re deployed on, which gives you greater visibility into how your Enclave resources are organized.



This change is a good opportunity for a quick review of how Stacks and Environments relate. Here’s what you need to know:","Homepage

Duct System

Whether you’re moving into a new home that you recently built or you’re simply worried about your existing home’s ducting, one of the most common questions that homeowners have about ducting is whether or not its size really matters. The short answer is yes, it certainly does. However, there’s a lot that goes into determining the right size of ducting and many reasons why getting the right size is imperative.

What is Ducting?
Ducting or ductwork is simply a series of ducts that run throughout a home. These open passages are used to deliver heated or cooled air to different locations throughout your home. Each main room of your home should have two different registers. One is meant to supply temperature-controlled air to the room, and the other is meant to remove stale air.","Plumbing

Dharamshala: Tibetan environmentalist and philanthropist Karma Samdrup was released after serving a 15-year prison sentence with five years of deprivation of political rights effective immediately. Based on media reports from exile, the Chinese sentencing document indicated Karma Samdrup’s imprisonment would continue until 19 November, with some evidence suggesting he might have been released around 18 November 2024. Samdrup reportedly suffers from a back-related health condition that prevents him from walking independently without assistance following his release.

For example:

A global study investigating performance in the Primary Years Programme (PYP) and Middle Years Programme (MYP) found that IB students outperformed their non-IB peers in mathematics, reading, narrative writing and expository writing.
Qualitative data from a 2014 study on the IB Diploma Programme (DP) in the USA suggested that students who participated in the DP during high school are more academically adjusted to the rigour and expectations of college.","About the IB

Charitable donations have long been a vital lifeline for patients struggling to afford life-saving medications, particularly those with chronic and rare diseases. Over the past few decades, various assistance programs—including nonprofit safety nets, third-party organizations, and manufacturer-sponsored free drug initiatives—have emerged to bridge the gap between medical advancements and patient affordability. However, despite these efforts, high out-of-pocket costs still prevent many individuals from accessing essential treatments. In an interview with Pharmaceutical Commerce, Jonathan James, CEO of Hope Charities, shares insights on reducing barriers to care and improving patient access.","About Us

Hello from Nairobi! I just took the eight hour flight from London Heathrow in British Airways’ first class (I’m on a discounted business class ticket, which I upgraded to first class using Avios).

As many of you may have noticed, I’ve been pretty positive towards British Airways on this trip — I loved their 747 upper deck business class, their new catering and bedding are both very good, and their A318 Club World London City service is one of the most enjoyable ways to cross the Atlantic.

So, did I view British Airways first class through a rosier lens this time around? Well, no, not really.

In the past I’ve called British Airways first class the world’s best business class. I stand by that sentiment, though nowadays I think it’s the world’s second best business class, as I think Qatar Airways Qsuites is an all around better experience.

Let’s start with the positives. As an avgeek I love flying the 747, and nowadays it’s a rare treat to be able to fly first class in the nose of the 747. British Airways squeezes 14 seats into this section, and being able to sit in seat 1A, right in the nose, was a real treat.","Advertiser Disclosure: Some links to credit cards and other products on this website will earn an affiliate commission.

There’s lots of meme maker websites, and even meme applications that you can install on your smartphone to makes memes on the run. You may even go one step further and create Dogecoin-themed meme templates which have a possibility of being seen by millions of others.

What makes a great meme? Well, it needs to be funny and convey meaning in a concise and relatable form. Moreover, capturing the sentiment of a community – or peoples’ innermost thoughts and feelings that are not shared publicly – can form a great basis from which to create highly engaging and novel memes. The power of memes also comes from their accessibility and ability to be viewed by millions in a relatively short of amount of time.

The main aim of this paper was to investigate the effect of four features of social media marketing on the purchase decision of consumers in the fast-food industry. It also aimed to determine if brand trust mediates the relationship between them. Necessary data was gathered from the visitors of different fast-food cafes in UAE via a quantitative online survey. After obtaining the desired responses, the data was analyzed by the AMOS 21- structural equation modeling.","About ScienceDirect

Habbio fibre is made from textile waste and recycled plastics that have been diverted from entering landfill and our oceans.

Habbio fibre is made from textile waste and recycled plastics that have been diverted from entering landfill and our oceans. These are then processed into an amazing polyester material that can be made into a hollow crimped fibre. Our fibre back cushions are 100% polyester and 100% recyclable.

Habbio has designed a range of sofas that are recyclable and non-toxic. Following an intensive period of research, Habbio has developed soft and supportive fibre fillings that give a better performance and comfort level than foam fillings.

We’re currently developing our website to make these items easily accessable. But in the meantime, if you would like to know more or order some replacement covers or extra units, please email into info@habbio.co.uk.

Our Eco Velvet fabrics are machine washable on a low intensity cycle of 30c or below. Cosy Threads and Zero Boucle are water & stain repellent and should be wiped with a damp cloth only. All Habbio fabrics are free from flourocarbons, PFOA and PFOS.

All Habbio fabrics are naturally stain resistant. We achieve this without adding flourocarbons, which we don’t think are necessary as our fabrics won’t absorb pigments from most household offenders. Should you have an incident, don’t panic but act whilst the stain is wet. Removing excess stain, blotting with a clean absorbent cloth and in dire circumstances deploying a good old fashioned sponge, soap and water will do the trick. Always allow the area to dry naturally.

A study finds that the concentration of microplastics in sea ice is three times higher than previously thought; melting ice and increased human activity in the region are expected to worsen the situation.

Arctic Sea Ice (Forum: S. Hendricks/Alfred Wegener Institute)
FROM THE OC – The North Pole haunts people's imagination as a wild, inhospitable, and inaccessible place. German researchers have just added another adjective to that list: tainted by plastic waste. They discovered that sea ice throughout the Arctic contains concentrations of microplastics three times higher than previously thought. And some of this trash is being spewed back into the sea as the ice melts due to climate change.","Sections

Powell Man Buys Model Submarine Used In The Hunt For Red October
A Powell man got into a bidding war in an online auction but was ultimately successful in purchasing the 11-foot model of the Red October used in the 1990 blockbuster movie “The Hunt For Red October."" He also purchased a model of the Soviet submarine and another prop used in the movie.

Daniel Cantone is a super fan of the blockbuster movie ""The Hunt for Red October."" He now owns the Red October, the title Soviet attack submarine featured in the movie — at least an 11-foot model used to make the film. He's pictured here with his son, Thomas.

The hunt for the Red October is over.

If the Soviet Navy of the 1980s is still in pursuit of that nation’s rogue Russian Typhoon-class submarine, it will have to follow their quarry to Powell, Wyoming. One of those Russian submarines has already followed it there.

The Red October and a Soviet attack submarine are two of the large model submarines built for the 1990 blockbuster movie “The Hunt for Red October,” based on John Clancy's 1984 novel.

They are now temporarily located in the office of Daniel Catone, an investment manager who fulfilled a lifelong passion by buying three props from the film during an online auction.","Team

Abstract
Online discussion boards are a standard learning management system (LMS) instructional tool used in the emerging online learning pedagogy. This pilot study examined an innovative approach that differs from how discussion boards have been commonly used. Using a retrospective, cross-sectional design, we evaluated the effect of shifting from traditional teacher and student-generated prompts to using student-generated videos with higher-order discussion questions to gauge student perceptions of peer feedback and engagement.","Abstract

The effectiveness of root canal treatment is well-established. However, misinformation continues to circulate on the Internet that may cause patients to question the safety of endodontics. Below are AAE resources designed to help dental professionals advocate for good dental health and root canal safety. It is in the best interest of patients to understand there is no valid, scientific evidence linking root canals to any health problems, and also to understand the advancements in modern dentistry that make endodontic treatment predictable, effective and successful.

Watch our Root Canal Safety video and share it with your patients to help explain that endodontic treatment is safe and effective.

Weshalb KI-Projekte lokale Betriebe konkurrenzfähiger machen und welche Chancen sich ergeben

Wie Künstliche Intelligenz lokale Unternehmen konkurrenzfähiger macht

Die Vorteile von Künstlicher Intelligenz (KI) für kleine und mittlere Unternehmen (KMU) sind vielfältig und umfangreich. Im Folgenden möchten wir einen genauen Blick auf den Nutzen von KI-Projekten für lokale Unternehmen werfen und wie sie diese konkurrenzfähiger machen können.

In erster Linie kann KI dabei helfen, Geschäftsprozesse zu automatisieren und zu optimieren. Das kann beispielsweise die Verwaltung von Kundendaten, die Durchführung von Marktanalysen oder die Verbesserung von Kundenerlebnissen sein. In vielen Fällen kann KI Geschäftsprozesse schneller und genauer durchführen als menschliche Mitarbeiter - und das rund um die Uhr.

Chancen durch KI-Projekte

Bei der Implementierung von KI ergeben sich mehrere Chancen für KMUs:

1. Effizienzsteigerung: Durch den Einsatz von KI lassen sich viele Prozesse, die bisher manuell durchgeführt wurden, automatisieren. Durch die Automatisierung können viele Arbeitsschritte beschleunigt und Fehler reduziert werden.","Impressum

Posted on June 15, 2023 by manchesterbmhstudents
Rania Velissaris, an MSc Genomic Medicine student, sheds lights on the interesting fusion of biology and programming. Rania offers some tips on getting into programming, even with no previous experience.

Computer programming

One might think that studying biology, the science of life, would not be associated with an interest in learning programming. However, given the increasing use of technology in scientific research – and the recent explosion of AI – learning to code has become a useful skill in the science community.

I still remember the unease I felt when I opened RStudio for the first time, but like any other skill, it just requires some perseverance. Luckily, there are a huge number of resources online which means that you don’t need a background in computer science to learn how to code.

Based on my own experiences, I wanted to share some tips and resources for biologists wanting to learn programming:","Home

Breakdown of Rates and Hours Needed to become a Private Pilot
You pay as you fly and after each flight, we bill your card on file. We also accept cash and check.

Everyone’s completion time is different and mostly depends on the individual’s study time and times per week flying. If you fly more often, you pick it up faster and typically save money in the long run. We recommend 2-3 times per week if possible. 

FAA’s minimum flight time required for Private Pilot Cert is 40hrs. 30 of those 40 hours have to be with an instructor. You'll also have an estimated 30 hours pre/post flight and additional ground instruction. Therefore your minimum estimate is:

$6400 for aircraft rental 


$2500 for instruction estimated 50 hours
$800 for practical test
$175 for knowledge test
$275 for books and equipment. ","Home

185,https://docs.djangoproject.com/fr/2.2/topics/db/models/,"Models¶
A model is the single, definitive source of information about your data. It contains the essential fields and behaviors of the data you’re storing. Generally, each model maps to a single database table.

The basics:

Each model is a Python class that subclasses django.db.models.Model.
Each attribute of the model represents a database field.
With all of this, Django gives you an automatically-generated database-access API; see Making queries.
Quick example¶
This example model defines a Person, which has a first_name and last_name:

from django.db import models

class Person(models.Model):
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
first_name and last_name are fields of the model. Each field is specified as a class attribute, and each attribute maps to a database column.

The above Person model would create a database table like this:

CREATE TABLE myapp_person (
    ""id"" serial NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    ""first_name"" varchar(30) NOT NULL,
    ""last_name"" varchar(30) NOT NULL

Forta Network is addressing one of crypto's most critical issues: real-time security and compliance. Through its Forta Firewall, the protocol screens transactions for malicious or non-compliant activity before they are executed onchain, shifting security from a reactive to a proactive approach.
The Firewall is powered by FORTRESS, a neural network model trained on real transaction data. It can simulate transactions in under 50 milliseconds, boasts a 99% detection rate of past hacks, and maintains a false positive rate below 0.0002%.
The Forta Chain, built on Arbitrum Orbit and launched in partnership with Conduit, supports the Firewall by recording flagged transactions in a decentralized, encrypted manner. The FORT token is used for governance, staking, access fees, and gas on Forta Chain.","Contents

Wealthfront is a broker iirc, so you have some private insurance to protect you in the event of Wealthfront becoming insolvent.
The difference between them and some bullshit thing like Yotta is you are the customer of record for the account. The bullshit aspect of Wealthfront is they front real services with automated investment services. Yotta was pooling customer funds at some other bullshit fintech who was then putting those funds (or not) into one big account.

Personally, handling cash is an old business and I’m really conservative about who handles mine. Innovation is risk, especially when the money behind it is focused on eliminating accountability. Yotta should have been illegal. Keep accounting boring.


        
Thorrez 10 months ago [–]

Wealthfront has multiple offerings. Wealthfront investment accounts are for stocks. Wealthfront Cash accounts are for cash. I was talking about Wealthfront Cash accounts, which don't have automated investment services, and I don't think involve a broker.",        Hacker Newsnew | past | comments | ask | show | jobs | submit    ,

Ilove talking to people and learning more about the investment market. This makes my role as a Relationship Manager incredibly fulfilling that it doesn’t feel like work to me.

At HSBC, we prioritise building strong relationships with our customers, which suits my skill-set – and it also leads to better outcomes. When I joined Hong Kong’s Sheung Shui branch, I was entrusted with a portfolio of clients from the Greater Bay Area of mainland China, as well as new walk-in customers. For the most part, they run businesses in mainland China and Hong Kong. Many have young children and I help set up funds or open bank accounts for them.","Terms and conditions

Superficial interactions can hinder community building and achieving larger goals. In a large company like Adobe, which has many divisions and over 28,000 employees, those community goals need to be focused on even more.

While I started as the EMEA Community Manager for the Adobe Support Community, during the pandemic I was promoted to manage our superusers, known as the Adobe Community Professionals. My experience working with influencers and superusers at other companies helped me see that there were some massive opportunities to unlock the potential of this community.","Use Cases

日期 2024-12-24来源：QuestMobile研究院
QuestMobile数据显示，截止到10月份，包括抖音、快手、小红书、哔哩哔哩、微博在内的新媒体平台全网去重活跃用户规模及渗透率分别达到10.71亿、85.7%。详情请看QuestMobile数据报告


报告导览




 

 

 

一、新媒体平台用户增长分化，竞争更聚焦在高价值用户，外延发展压缩其他垂直行业空间
1、新媒体平台全网渗透率逐年走高，渐趋天花板，增长步伐放缓
2、2024年新媒体平台增长趋势分化，抖音 “大象起舞”，依旧保持增长势头，小红书凝聚后起之势，有赶超哔哩哔哩的倾向

3、从用户画像来看，高用户基数平台相对均衡发展，用户基数相对低的平台保持其核心圈层的同时，试图实现破圈发展

抖音快手受众更广；微博小红书较相似，以35岁以下女性为主；哔哩哔哩与小红书均逐步扭转过往性别偏向单一的状况。

4、微博、哔哩哔哩、小红书人群发达城市高消费能力特征更显著；抖音、快手对下沉市场的普及度更高

5、用户倾向集中使用少数新媒体平台，中小平台面临更大生存压力

使用两个新媒体平台及以下用户比例增加1.8个百分点，若平台难续优质独特内容，用户容易转至更全能平台，促使资源流量进一步向头部优势平台聚集。

6、在细分的高价值用户上，中小平台仍有赶超综合性平台的可能性

QuestMobile数据显示，小红书、微博、哔哩哔哩高价值用户占比超越抖音与快手，分别达39.7%、33.3%、32.6%。

7、新媒体平台间高价值用户的争夺尤为激烈

QuestMobile数据显示，典型新媒体平台高价值用户重合率多高于整体用户；与抖音相比，微博和快手对高价值用户的吸引力有所下滑。

8、新媒体平台具备生活娱乐、资讯获取、知识学习等多方面的功能属性，对其他垂直平台形成渗透和替代

 

二、内容生态供需特征及变化

1、平台的差异化发展与技术的快速变革共同塑造着当下多元的内容格局

1.1 新媒体平台持续推出内容&创作者策略，旨在促进平台生态健康发展和形成平台差异化用户吸引力

1.2 娱乐生活内容稳固基本盘，垂类内容如游戏、短剧逐步发展壮大；传统文化、个人提升内容崭露头角，有望成为新的增长点

1.3 抖音快手从新兴内容入手寻找新流量增长点，微博持续稳固基本盘，小红书与哔哩哔哩分别以差别于核心用户的内容试图破圈

1.4 短剧市场在新媒体平台的推动下正蓬勃发展

各新媒体平台积极推出扶持政策，推动短剧精品化，上线独立短剧APP推动短剧商业化。

1.5 抖音短剧内容供给增长更快，快手短剧创作者类型更为聚焦

QuestMobile数据显示，2024年10月，抖音平台短剧内容稿件量占比上涨6.1%，短剧内容渗透率达66.1%，热门短剧发布者重点分布在剧情搞笑及影视娱乐类账号；快手平台短剧渗透率达73.6%，热门短剧发布者中影视娱乐类账号超8成。

1.6 新媒体平台借助AI工具助力创作者提效，且积极开展AI内容治理，双管齐下营造良好内容生态

1.7 新媒体平台站内用户亦对AI工具保持关注

即梦上线当天即在抖音平台引发了高涨的讨论热度，可灵AI通过热度的持续积累也在快手站内出现热度峰值。

2、泛娱乐类KOL仍具有广泛粉丝群体，但随用户需求变化，健康养生、实用内容输出型KOL快速成长

2.1 抖音、快手、微博平台的中坚力量持续稳固与发展，小红书、哔哩哔哩小量级达人竞争更加激烈

2.2 小量级达人在哔哩哔哩、小红书平台收获更多成长机会

QuestMobile数据显示，2024年10月，哔哩哔哩、小红书平台中粉丝数同比增长的KOL数量占比分别为90.4%、87.2%。

2.3 剧情搞笑和影视娱乐类达人在多个平台都有广泛粉丝基础；除泛娱乐类KOL外，各平台垂类领域KOL呈现平台特色

2.4 健康、自我提升相关实用内容为KOL扩大受众群体

纵观五大平台，健康养生类KOL粉丝增速第一，教育培训、创业职场类干货型KOL也备受追捧；从单平台看，哔哩哔哩平台汽车类KOL粉丝数增长尤为亮眼，达到25.6%。

 

三、流量与平台调性共同影响平台商业化进程，内容与电商耦合加深

1、流量对平台的硬广收入起决定性作用，随着用户对新媒体平台的使用行为加深，其商业价值上行


2、各新媒体平台硬广收入来源呈现显著差异，抖音、快手、微博硬广收入行业集中度低，小红书与哔哩哔哩则呈现鲜明的行业聚焦

抖音与小红书平台美妆护理硬广收入居首，快手、微博、哔哩哔哩则为来自网络购物平台硬广收入最高。



3、内容平台带货成为平台与KOL商业变现的关键路径之一，软广商业化和平台调性紧密相关，抖音与小红书软广商业价值尤为突出



4、抖音凭借高流量和强用户粘性，吸引品牌进行高金额投放；小红书依靠浓郁的种草氛围，在软广投放数量方面占据优势



5、从互动角度来看，抖音篇均投放效果与效率更优，适合短期内追求高曝光的品牌；小红书收藏倾向较高，更适合“长期蓄水”

在小红书的互动指标中，较高的收藏倾向意味着用户对商单所推广的产品存在潜在购买意向，用户通过收藏将感兴趣的产品或服务进行 “标记”，以便后续做出购买决策。

Understand why milk is an important part of a child’s diet and the differences between dairy and plant-based milks





Main Content Intro Image
What your child drinks plays a key role in their health, and today, parents seem to have more choices than ever. Milk sections in grocery stores have expanded to offer an increasing number of options including many dairy alternatives. While this can be helpful to families with food allergies or intolerances, it can also make it challenging to know what's the best milk for your child.

""Milk is an important part of a child's diet due to its nutrient content to help develop healthy bones, regulate blood pressure and maintain a healthy weight,"" says Otoniel Santiago, a clinical dietitian with Get Up & Go by Children's Health℠. ""Many plant-based milks do not match dairy's essential nutrients so it's important for parents to understand their options.""

2月27日晚间，第三方云计算服务商优刻得（688158.SH）发布2024年度业绩快报，报告期内公司营收净利双双下滑、净利润续亏，实现营业收入15.06亿元，同比减少0.63%；归母净利润亏损约2.37亿元，扣非后归母净利润亏损2.44亿元，亏损幅度较上年同期有所收窄。单季度看，去年前三季度优刻得归母净利亏损1.65亿元，根据全年亏损计算，第四季度亏损约7200万元，为年内单季度亏损之最。

持续进行人员优化和控制费用支出，是优刻得在2024年收入规模减少的情况下，实现综合毛利率从上年同期11.11%回升至20.74%的原因之一，公司称：“持续进行人员优化，节约开支，提升人效。”另外，报告期内，优刻得的销售费用、管理费用和研发费用较上年同期减少2583.13万元，降低了亏损规模。

第一财经记者注意到，2021年以来优刻得的员工总数不断减少，wind数据显示，2021年-2023年分别为1245名、890名、867名。

此外，优刻得表示，2024年公司在AIGC领域的持续投入，使得智算产品收入快速增长；同时，边缘云等低毛利率业务占比减少，收入结构得到优化。此外，伴随两个自建数据中心分阶段投产，高毛利的机柜托管业务增加，公有云和混合云的成本得到优化，盈利能力得以提升。",广告联系法律声明关于我们上海市市场监督管理局国家网信办举报中心上海互联网举报中心友情链接,

It’s impossible to ignore how life has changed since COVID-19 spread across the world. People from all over quarantined and did their best to keep on going during the pandemic. Zibby Owens, host of the award-winning podcast MomsDon’t Have Time to Read Books and a mother of four herself, wanted to do something to help people carry on and to give them something to focus on other than the horrors of their news feeds. So she launched an online magazine called We Found Time.

Authors who had been on her podcast wrote original, brilliant essays for busy readers. Zibby organized these profound pieces into themes inspired by five things moms don’t have time to do: eat, read, work out, breathe, and have sex. Now compiled as an anthology named Moms Don’t Have Time To, these beautiful, original essays by dozens of bestselling and acclaimed authors speak to the ever-increasing demands on our time, especially during the quarantine, in a unique, literary way.","About Us

Avec Docteur Canalisation, plus besoin de remplacer vos réseaux : nous les rénovons de l’intérieur grâce à nos procédés de curage et de chemisage.

Résultat : des conduites propres, décapées et performantes comme au premier jour.


Nos interventions sont rapides, durables et surtout sans travaux lourds pour vos bâtiments.

​

Docteur Canalisation : la solution moderne pour redonner vie à vos canalisations.

Solution 1:
Chemisage par spray & Brush 
Solution 1 : la réhabilitation par projection de résine
​

Cette méthode moderne permet de restaurer vos canalisations en déposant, directement à l’intérieur, une résine époxy haute performance projetée par un robot équipé d’une caméra HD.

​

Le revêtement formé agit comme une coque protectrice : il scelle fissures et micro-fuites, neutralise la corrosion et redonne aux conduites leur étanchéité et leur résistance initiales.

​

L’opération débute généralement depuis les accès situés en hauteur (toitures, combles, terrasses). Nos techniciens introduisent d’abord un robot de préparation chargé de décaper les parois, puis un système de pulvérisation.
Dotée d’une tête rotative, cette unité diffuse la résine sur toute la circonférence des canalisations, en plusieurs couches successives, pour obtenir une épaisseur finale proche de 3 mm","Docteur Canalisation

216,https://automaticcss.com/docs/spacing-variables/,"Spacing Variables
Spacing variables allow you to hook into the ACSS spacing system for establishing consistent, responsive spacing for things like margins, padding, and gaps.

The most important thing to wrap your head around is that spacing is spacing. Unlike with classes, which have to declare what they’re applying spacing to (e.g. margin-top), spacing variables are just pure spacing values. They can be used anywhere, so they don’t require specific names.

For example, let’s say you want to apply padding to a testimonial card you’re creating. Since this is a re-usable element, you’re creating a BEM class for it called .testimonial-card and assigning all styles to the custom class instead of using utility classes.

Here’s what that would look like:

.testimonial-card {
    padding: var(--space-m);
}

Notice there is no var(--pad-m) variable. Once again, spacing is just spacing and variables are just values. You could use the same value to gap the card’s content out:

.testimonial-card {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    padding: var(--space-m);
    gap: var(--space-m);
}

The only exception here would be contextual variables.","Welcome

Abstract
Despite extensive genetic diversity of HIV-1 in chronic infection, infant HIV-1 infection involves selective transmission of a single or few maternal virus variants. These transmitted/founder (T/F) variants are of particular interest, as a maternal or infant HIV vaccine should raise envelope (Env)-specific IgG responses capable of blocking this group of viruses. However, the maternal or infant factors that contribute to selection of infant T/F viruses are not well understood. In this study, we isolated HIV-1 env genes by single genome amplification from 16 mother-infant transmitting pairs from the U.S. pre-antiretroviral era Women Infant Transmission Study (WITS). Infant T/F and representative maternal non-transmitted Env variants from plasma were identified and used to generate pseudoviruses for paired maternal plasma neutralization sensitivity analysis. Eighteen out of 21 (85%) infant T/F Env pseudoviruses were neutralization resistant to paired maternal plasma. Yet, all infant T/F viruses were neutralization sensitive to a panel of HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies and variably sensitive to heterologous plasma neutralizing antibodies.","Topics

Les liens entre l’art et les mouvements sociaux sont pluriels selon les contextes historiques et les configurations sociales (Sociétés et Représentations 2001). Les approches qu’on peut en faire le sont elles aussi. Il est possible d’étudier comment l’art se fait, parfois, le vecteur de la contestation sociale et politique, par ses contenus mais aussi par ses formes, et comment, réciproquement, l’art peut être mobilisé dans des pratiques de contestation qui le débordent très largement. Selon le degré d’autonomie que les champs artistiques d’une part, l’espace des mouvements sociaux (Mathieu 2004) et le champ politique, d’autre part, entretiennent les uns par rapport aux autres, les liens mutuels peuvent aboutir à un enrôlement politique plus ou moins grand de l’œuvre, allant de l’hétéronomie – le réalisme socialiste en littérature en constitue une figure paradigmatique, bien que complexe – au simple compagnonnage sans engagement de l’œuvre – le modèle pétitionnaire des écrivains mettant leur nom au service d’une cause en fournit un exemple.","Applying for OpenEdition Books

The apostle Paul talked about how he planted a seed, and how his fellow disciple, Apollos, watered that seed, but how it was God who made things grow. Recently at Michigan State University, we had a taste of what that’s like.

There was a young man named Troy* who I’d seen around campus. I thought his heart was hardened toward Jesus, so I was surprised to see him at our Navigator Christmas party.

Troy grew up in the church and was familiar with the Bible, but he was rejecting God and living his own way. Almost two years ago, however, he met Alyssa, a student involved in our ministry. Troy couldn’t help but notice her transformed life, her unconditional love, and her passion for God. Alyssa had even shared the Gospel with Troy and some others while they were watching a show about demons.","©2025 The Navigators. All Rights Reserved.

Opresidente da República, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, sanciona, nesta quinta-feira (27), a lei que cria o programa de Mobilidade Verde e Inovação (Mover), durante reunião do Conselho de Desenvolvimento Econômico Social Sustentável, o Conselhão. O programa estimula investimentos em novas rotas tecnológicas e aumenta as exigências de descarbonização da frota automotiva brasileira, incluindo carros de passeio, ônibus e caminhões.

Para o vice-presidente e ministro do Desenvolvimento, Indústria, Comércio e Serviços (MDIC), Geraldo Alckmin, o programa mostra o acerto do governo federal de impulsionar a inovação e descarbonização do setor automotivo nacional. “É o maior programa de estímulo à mobilidade e à descarbonização de toda história da indústria automotiva. E já está dando resultados. Desde o lançamento do Mover, no final do ano passado, já temos uma série de anúncios de investimentos do setor automotivo, que já somam R$ 130 bilhões”, destaca o ministro.","Acesso à Informação

If authorized, F-1 students may engage in on-campus or off-campus employment. M-1 students may only engage in employment for purposes of practical training.[1]

A. On-Campus Employment
F-1 students may engage in on-campus employment subject to certain conditions and restrictions.[2] F-1 status permits students with Designated School Official (DSO) approval to work at an on-campus job for up to 20 hours per week when school is in session.[3] During vacation periods, students may work on-campus full-time.[4]

Employment may be performed at off-campus locations that are educationally affiliated with the school and the employment must be an integral part of the student’s educational program.[5] Students working on campus may be employed by the school itself or by any independent companies serving the school’s needs, such as the school bookstore or cafeteria suppliers providing food on campus premises. The employment must not displace U.S. residents.[6]

An F-1 student may be employed on-campus for duration of status, but may not begin more than 30 days before the start of classes.[7] F-1 students engaged in on-campus employment are not required to apply for employment authorization with USCIS.","Topics

The 2822 MKII Series is the latest offering from KONI, designed by their team of experienced engineers with a rich history in motorsports. Building on the proven technology of the 2812MKII, the 2822 series is a step up with its 4-way adjustability.

Unlike the 2-way adjustable 2812MKII, the 2822 is a high-pressure gas shock absorber with a double wall design and is specifically crafted for competitive driving. The two bump and two rebound adjusters can be fine-tuned while on the car and offer independent low and high speed adjustments.

The 2822 series stands out with its advanced adjustment cartridge that uses a superior method for controlling the opening and closing of valve-loaded ports, resulting in a consistent and accurate damping curve. Positive lock detents ensure that each port can only be in an open or closed state. The cartridges are available in different configurations to cater to various needs and requirements.

The low and high speed damping are generated by the piston area and not by rod displacement, which results in precise control over the damping forces with minimal phase lag. The bump adjuster has its own separate reservoir to provide extra oil flow, making the installation simple and lightweight.

All adjusters are completely independent and offer 8 predefined positions with distinct stops. The wide adjustment range is divided into equal steps, allowing for customization to meet specific needs. With its commitment to quality and close relationship with Dallara, KONI remains at the forefront of innovation and technology in motorsports.","Menu

Les sapeurs-pompiers ""mobilisés pour sécuriser préventivement les JOP à la demande de l’État bénéficieront d’une prime, laquelle sera prise en charge totalement ou partiellement par l’État"", indique un projet de décret dont AEF info a eu copie. De plus, l’indemnité de mobilisation opérationnelle, habituellement versée dans le cadre des mesures préventives feux de forêts, va être étendue pour les JOP. Le texte sera examiné lors d’une plénière extraordinaire du CSFPT, le 5 juillet 2024. Ces indemnités seront mises en œuvre ""par le projet de décret et un arrêté subséquent"", précise le texte.

Funding from Stripe Balance

Pull funding (US-only)
Using the Stripe Dashboard or API, you can access the bank account and routing information you need to push funds from your external bank account. When that account receives funds, they’re immediately available as a top-up to your Stripe account’s Issuing balance.

For a given currency, the provided bank account information will be unique and able to receive funds any number of times. Funds always arrive in your Issuing balance in the specified currency. In some cases, your bank might perform currency conversion.","Overview

Groupthink (pemikiran kelompok) dan dampaknya terhadap kreativitas
Groupthink (pemikiran kelompok) dan dampaknya terhadap kreativitas
Groupthink adalah fenomena psikologis yang terjadi ketika sekelompok individu menghargai keharmonisan dan kesesuaian di atas pemikiran kritis dan penilaian independen. Dalam skenario pemikiran kelompok, keinginan untuk konsensus dan kesatuan dalam kelompok menjadi lebih penting daripada mempertimbangkan perspektif alternatif atau mengevaluasi gagasan secara kritis. Hal ini dapat menyebabkan pengambilan keputusan yang salah dan kurangnya kreativitas dalam kelompok.

Di tempat kerja, groupthink dapat terwujud dalam berbagai cara. Salah satu contohnya adalah ketika karyawan atau pemimpin menghindari pendapatyang berbeda, dan memilih kesepakatan dan kesesuaian. Hal ini bisa terjadi karena tekanan sosial, ketakutan akan konflik, atau keinginan untuk menjaga keharmonisan dalam kelompok. Akibatnya, ide-ide inovatif, sudut pandang berbeda, dan kritik konstruktif ditekan, sehingga membatasi potensi kreativitas yang mengakibatkan lingkungan kerja yang stagnan dan tidak produktif.","

A un certain moment de son activité de consultant.e, on peut ressentir comme un palier dans sa prospection : trop de temps passé avec des prospects peu intéressés par son offre, trop de personnalisation dans ses offres (pas assez de productivité).

Comment passer ce cap qui peut vous libérer du temps ou vous offrir plus de clients avec qui vous êtes en phase ?

Une des meilleures techniques de freelance pour dynamiser son activité consiste à :

Identifier la vraie valeur de son offre pour son « client idéal » puis
Dupliquer des actions de prospection sur le même profil de client, de manière plus automatisée et plus rentable.
Les start up parlent de « scaler » leur activité, ou de passer à l’échelle. Pourquoi pas vous ? Cela passe par une méthode simple.

D’abord, comment identifier son offre « idéale » ? Vos clients actuels détiennent les réponses. Il faut les questionner. Cependant, on hésite souvent à entamer le dialogue avec eux. Et pourtant, cette étape est cruciale pour améliorer votre processus de vente de manière productive.","Découvrir le portage salarial

传统抗肿瘤药物的临床应用现状与发展
徐焦1, 蒙凌华2, 卿晨1通讯作者qingchenhhh@qq.com     
摘要: 传统抗肿瘤药物是指能够直接杀伤肿瘤细胞，抑制肿瘤细胞生长、增殖的一类细胞毒类化疗药物。由芥子气衍生而来的氮芥于1946年用于治疗淋巴瘤，揭开了现代肿瘤化学治疗的序幕。以氮芥为起始，包括烷化剂、抗代谢、抗癌抗生素和抗肿瘤植物药等多种类抗肿瘤药物被陆续开发用于临床治疗。传统抗肿瘤药物是肿瘤化疗的基石，在恶性肿瘤的综合治疗和新辅助治疗中占有重要地位。近年来，传统抗肿瘤药物通过与分子靶向治疗、免疫治疗及放射治疗的联合应用，极大地提高了肿瘤患者的生存率。随着对肿瘤基因组和肿瘤发生发展机制研究的不断深入，精准医学和个体化治疗的理念被提出并在临床实践中取得成功。在此背景下，传统抗肿瘤药物的个性化治疗策略也有待进一步研究和优化。本文综述了近年来传统抗肿瘤药物的临床应用情况和研究进展。","显示缩略图

REASONS FOR DECISION

 

INTRODUCTION

[1]               The inadvertent disclosure of a privileged document by one side of a legal dispute to another is not unlike the transmission of an infection:  the more quickly it is contained, the easier it may be to eradicate its harmful effect.

[2]               Where nothing is done to deal with the problem, however, the prejudicial effect of the inadvertent disclosure of a privileged document on the adjudication of the dispute between the parties, in particular, and the integrity of the legal system, in general, can spread to the point where there is no alternative but to isolate the affected party, as I have reluctantly concluded I must do in this case.","Terms of Use

Desde su capital, esta ruta descubre la riqueza natural y cultural de un país con influencias de Oriente y Occidente. Esto es lo que no te puedes perder.
Emma Lira
Actualizado a 21 de octubre de 2025 · 13:08


Los romanos la llamaron Albania por la blancura de sus cumbres nevadas, pero sus habitantes prefieren llamarla Shqiperia, que significa ""águila"", refiriéndose a la inexpugnabilidad de su territorio. Su bandera presenta un águila bicéfala, símbolo heredado de Bizancio, que funciona como un símbolo del equilibrio entre Oriente y Occidente. Rodeada por los Balcanes y los Alpes Dináricos, y bañada por los mares Jónico y Adriático, Albania guarda la rica historia de los territorios fronterizos. Fue parte de la Iliria del Epiro griego y resistió la conquista romana. Tras la división del imperio en 395, Albania se alineó con Bizancio. Durante la Edad Media, enfrentó a los otomanos, liderados por Skanderberg, quien resistió la embestida por más de 25 años. A pesar de su derrota en el siglo XV, Albania fue parte del Imperio otomano durante cinco siglos.","España

UMAUSDT Forming Falling Wedge
UMAUSDT is showing a falling wedge pattern, which is widely recognized as a bullish reversal indicator in technical analysis. This pattern typically forms during a downtrend when price movements begin to narrow, suggesting that bearish momentum is losing strength and a potential breakout to the upside may be near. The good trading volume observed reinforces this outlook, indicating that accumulation may already be taking place as traders anticipate a strong upward push. If a breakout occurs above the resistance line, UMAUSDT could see impressive gains of 90% to 100%+ in the coming sessions. From a chart perspective, the falling wedge formation often precedes major bullish rallies when confirmed by increasing volume and consistent higher lows. UMAUSDT’s current setup fits this narrative perfectly, with clear signs of consolidation before an expected surge. Technical traders often view such patterns as prime opportunities to enter ahead of a reversal, especially when supported by favorable market sentiment and growing investor interest. The recent uptick in attention from market participants further supports the bullish potential of UMAUSDT. Investors appear to be positioning early, recognizing the value opportunity as the token approaches a critical technical breakout zone. This growing confidence could fuel a strong buying wave once confirmation is achieved, setting the stage for a sustained upward trend. ✅ Show your support by hitting the like button and ✅ Leaving a comment below!

UMAUSDT Forming Bullish Wave
UMAUSDT is currently demonstrating a bullish wave pattern, signaling strong upward momentum and trend continuation. This wave formation suggests that the coin has entered a healthy impulsive phase, where higher highs and higher lows are forming consistently. The recent price action shows accumulation at key support levels, followed by breakout moves that align with this bullish structure, indicating renewed confidence among buyers. Volume has remained consistently strong, which adds further credibility to the bullish wave pattern. Increasing trading volume during each leg up is a key confirmation that institutional and retail traders alike are stepping in. UMA, the native token of the UMA protocol focused on decentralized finance derivatives, is gaining traction again, fueled by both technical momentum and renewed interest in DeFi utility tokens. With an expected gain range of 40% to 45%+, UMA appears poised for a substantial upside move if the current pattern plays out. Key resistance levels will need to be tested and broken, but the wave structure suggests buyers are in control. This setup presents an appealing opportunity for swing traders and trend followers who look for high-potential breakout trades with strong volume support. ✅ Show your support by hitting the like button and ✅ Leaving a comment below!

UMAUSDT — Major Battle at Demand Zone, Waiting for Breakout?
🔎 Overview The weekly chart of UMA/USDT is showing a very interesting setup: Since 2021, price action has been consistently forming lower highs, capped by a long-term descending trendline (yellow line). On the other side, buyers continue to defend the strong demand zone at 1.20 – 1.70 (yellow box). This structure has formed a multi-year descending triangle/base — a strong sign of long-term accumulation and compression. In short, UMA is now at a crucial decision point: either a breakout that may spark a new bullish phase, or a breakdown toward new lows. --- 🟢 Bullish Scenario 1. The first confirmation will be a weekly close above the descending trendline and key horizontal level 2.28 USDT. 2. If confirmed, potential upside targets are: 2.94 USDT → minor resistance 3.50 USDT → psychological level & prior supply zone 4.30 USDT → major resistance 6.96 USDT → extended target for strong momentum 3. A high-volume breakout could trigger a short squeeze, accelerating price movement upward. 📌 Key point: A breakout above 2.28 could open the door toward the 4–7 USDT range. --- 🔴 Bearish Scenario 1. If the price fails to hold 1.20 – 1.30 USDT, the major demand zone collapses. 2. Next key downside target will be 0.888 USDT (the historical low). 3. Losing that level would push UMA into new price discovery to the downside, with no strong support below. 📌 Key point: Below 1.20, bearish pressure dominates, with risk of retesting 0.888 USDT. --- 📐 Pattern & Current Setup Pattern: Multi-year descending triangle with flat demand vs sloping supply. Current state: Sideways inside demand, waiting for a decisive move. Sentiment: Neutral → Bullish if breakout confirmed, Bearish if demand breaks. Weekly timeframe: Always wait for weekly close confirmations, not just intraday wicks. --- ⚖️ Trading Plan & Risk Management Conservative traders: Wait for a confirmed breakout and retest above 2.28 before entering. Aggressive traders: May accumulate small positions inside 1.20–1.70 demand zone with tight stop-loss below 1.20. Risk/Reward: Attractive setup since downside is limited (tight invalidation), while upside targets are layered and potentially exponential. --- 🔥 Final Takeaway: UMA is at a multi-year inflection point. As long as the demand zone holds, it remains an attractive accumulation area. A breakout above the descending trendline could trigger a strong bullish reversal, while losing 1.20 would expose UMA to retest its historical low at 0.888. #UMA #UMAUSDT #CryptoAnalysis #TechnicalAnalysis #PriceAction #DescendingTriangle #SupportResistance #BreakoutSetup #CryptoTrading #AltcoinAnalysis

BufferGeometry는 Three.js 내의 모든 geometry를 나타냅니다(r125에서부터 Geometry가 제거되었습니다). 좀 더 자세히 말하면 특정 BufferAttribute라고 부르는 속성의 집합이죠.

각 BufferAttribute는 위치(positions), 법선(normals), 색(colors), uv 데이터의 배열이고, 이들을 모으면 각 꼭지점에 대한 평행 배열 형식의 데이터가 됩니다.


그림을 보면 총 4개의 속성(attribute), position, normal, color, uv가 있습니다. 이들은 평행 배열로 각 속성의 N 번째 데이터 묶음이 한 꼭지점의 데이터를 나타냅니다. 표시한 index = 4 위치의 꼭지점 데이터를 보세요. 이 묶음이 하나의 꼭지점을 정의합니다.

이 경우 맞닿은 면의 색이 다르기에, 이 모서리는 각 면에 다른 법선을 제공해야 합니다. 마찬가지로 UV도 달라야 하죠. 하나의 꼭지점은 위 4개 속성의 묶음이고, 때문에 속성이 달라진다면 그건 다른 꼭지점이 되는 것이죠.

이전과 마찬가지로 BufferGeometry로 정육면체를 만들어보겠습니다. 굳이 정육면체를 쓰는 이유는 모서리의 꼭지점을 공유하는 듯해도 사실 그렇지 않기 때문이죠. 필요한 꼭지점을 전부 생성한 후, 꼭지점 데이터를 평행 배열로 변환해 BufferAttribute를 만들고, 이를 BufferGeometry에 추가해야","Three.js란?

Most of the discussion is still on transfer pricing
US wants the simplified framework to be mandatory
Talks on moving forward with the OECD’s two-pillar global tax deal are stuck, as countries remain divided over a key part of the agreement, a senior official said Saturday.

The major point of disagreement is still with a framework for transfer pricing known as Amount B, which seeks to simplify the way companies value certain intercompany transactions. Transfer pricing refers to transactions between related companies that are part of multinational groups.

“The text is largely stable,” said Achim Pross, deputy director of the OECD’s Center for Tax Policy and Administration. Pross was speaking at a tax conference in Mumbai organized ...

306,https://www.tcsg.edu/ecampus/scc-grant/about-the-grant/,"The Strengthening Community Colleges Grant, awarded through the US Department of Labor, aims to build the capacity of community colleges to meet local and regional labor market demands for a skilled workforce. It is a systems change grant that is housed at Savannah Technical College, in Savannah, GA.

In Georgia, “changing the system” has meant reinventing how we train students in three key industry sectors: healthcare, manufacturing/logistics, and IT. Using advanced educational tools in the classroom, in courses which feature digital badges and industry-leading micro-credentials, we’re helping our students excel in the 21st century job market.

Manufacturing Industry

Healthcare Industry

 IT Industry
And we’re helping students gain the skills they need quickly. We recognize that job-ready candidates benefit from targeted instruction which blends cutting edge technology, soft-skill training, exposure to employers, and industry defined skills and competencies in short, manageable packages that provide Georgians with life-changing career upgrades in as little as 4 to 6 weeks.

Students who participate in a 4 week “Fast Track” course will receive a digital badge (as well as associated industry micro-credentials) upon successful completion. These stackable course badges sit within well-defined and visual learning pathways that illuminate additional courses, career goals, and technical certificate, diploma, and degree trajectories. TCSG students are able to see course-level badges as stepping stones to their educational and career goals, offering encouragement to those in progress and inspiration for those determining their next steps.

Mercredi, 24 Septembre 2008 14:58EnvoyerImprimer
«Les fraudes aux allocations familiales explosent !», «Augmentation de 73% des fraudes recensées par la CNAF en 2007 !» : tels sont les titres alarmistes — et sensationnalistes — que l'on peut lire ici et là.

Or ce «boom sans précédent» s'explique, tout simplement, par la montée en puissance des dispositifs de contrôle avec la mise place d'outils de plus en plus perfectionnés, comme le «répertoire national des bénéficiaires» (RNB) et bientôt, peut-être, la «sémantique stratégique» ?

En réalité, le montant des «fraudes» aux prestations s'élève à 58,4 millions d'euros en 2007, sur un versement total de… 66 milliards. Soit un taux de… 0,1%. En 2006, le préjudice s'était élevé à 35,1 millions sur 64 milliards d’€, soit un taux de fraude de 0,05%.

Avec un taux de contrôle renforcé à 35%, la CNAF a relevé 6.314 «fraudes» en 2007, contre 3.654 l'année précédente. 62% ont résulté de déclarations d'activités ou de ressources non à jour — donc des «indus», qu'on ne peut qualifier de fraude. La fraude avérée résidait, elle, dans les dissimulations de concubinage (24%) et les escroqueries, faux et usage de faux (14%). Sur la base de cette semi-vérité, les trois prestations les plus «fraudées» seraient les aides au logement (30%), le RMI (28%) et l'API (8%).",Copyright © 2009 APNÉE. Tous droits réservés.,

Clear + Brilliant
Clear + Brilliant is advanced technology that uses a gentle laser to change and refresh your skin from the inside out and helps fight the natural effects of aging on your skin. This treatment is good for the 45 and under age group who are starting to see the early signs of aging appear on their skin. This specialized treatment should be done in a series of 4-6 sessions to get the best results.

Benefits
Radiant, glowing skin with minimized pore appearance
Smoother texture and more even skin tone
Prevents early signs of aging to help maintain younger looking skin
Minimal downtime
How Clear + Brilliant works
Once the skin is prepped, the laser tip makes multiple passes over the skin. You may feel a warm tingly or prickling sensation. The non-ablative fractional laser creates millions of microscopic treatment zones in your skin, replacing damaged skin with healthy, younger looking tissue. It selectively heats up and damages the deeper dermal tissue while leaving the superficial epidermis intact. What to expect from Clear + Brilliant.

Once your treatment is complete, the skin may appear red and feel warm immediately after your treatment. You are free to resume your normal activities. This treatment will create some sensitivity to the sun and it is recommended that you avoid direct sunlight for two days following the procedure and wear a broad spectrum medical grade sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher.

I rented one of their carpet cleaners and am very happy with the results. The machine is relatively small. Small enough that I, a 71 yr old senior, was able to unload it and load it back into my car without hurting myself. I was also able to operate it without issues. The best part - $25 for 24 hours! Can't beat that.

It's important to remember the ongoing controversial statements by the creator of the Harry Potter franchise. CBR supports the hard work of industry professionals on properties fans know and love and the wider world of Harry Potter that fans have adopted as their own. You can find CBR's continuing coverage of Rowling here.

It's been years since the main Harry Potter series concluded, but the nostalgia of the saga still spawns theories about some of its most important moments. As every fan knows, Harry survived the killing curse as a baby because his mother's love protected him. However, after Voldemort returned using Harry's blood to regain his full body, he was allowed to touch Harry without suffering negative consequences. This raises the question of how Harry survived the killing curse a second time in Deathly Hallows.","Join Our Team

Activity tracking
Strava is great for tracking your workouts, but its built-in analytics can feel a bit limited if you're a data nerd (like me). That's why I built Statistics for Strava—a tool that digs deeper into your activity data to show trends, visualizations, and alternative stats that Strava doesn’t surface. Whether you're a weekend warrior or a hardcore athlete, you'll find new ways to explore your performance. You can run it on your own server, own your data, and even extend it if you like.

21.04.2025 03:48

21 квітня 2025 року карти Таро дають своєрідний прогноз для кожного знака зодіаку. Цей день буде сповнений важливих подій, як на особистому фронті, так і в професійному житті. Залежно від вашого знака, вам варто звернути увагу на певні аспекти: чи то активність, чи то концентрація на меті, чи навіть розслаблення в любові та роботі. У нашій статті ми розглянемо, який гороскоп по картах Таро підготував 21 квітня для всіх знаків зодіаку.

ОВЕН (21 березня - 20 квітня): Зірка
Карти Таро для Овнів на 21 квітня пророкують, що день буде удачливим. В особистих стосунках рекомендується проявити любов і увагу, а на роботі варто розслабитися і не перенапружуватися. Зірка символізує гармонію, тому Овнам можна дозволити собі насолоджуватися результатами своєї роботи та стосунками без зайвих турбот.

ТЕЛЕЦЬ (21 квітня - 21 травня): Лицар жезлів
Для Тільців 21 квітня буде часом активних дій. У стосунках важливо проявити ініціативу і рухатися вперед. Карта Лицаря жезлів вказує на те, що Тільці можуть досягти нових вершин, якщо не зупинятимуться на досягнутому. На кар'єрному шляху також не варто стояти на місці — рухайтеся вперед.

БЛИЗНЯТА (22 травня - 21 червня): Лицар пентаклів
Близнятам варто сконцентруватися на своїх цілях. Карта Лицаря пентаклів підказує, що цей день важливий для роздумів. В особистих стосунках важливо знайти спільну мету для розвитку, а на роботі — визначитися з напрямком і прагнути досягти бажаного.

РАК (22 червня - 22 липня): Дев'ятка пентаклів
Для Раків цей день принесе відчуття досягнутого успіху. В особистих стосунках варто дозволити партнеру проявити ініціативу. На роботі все йде добре, але не забувайте про відпочинок і підтримку близьких. Дев'ятка пентаклів означає задоволення від результатів.

ЛЕВ (23 липня - 23 серпня): Сонце
Левам у цей день світить Сонце. Це карта радості та успіху, яка вказує на те, що стосунки будуть теплими і гармонійними. Леви можуть діяти активно на роботі, і це принесе їм позитивні результати. Тому цей день — чудовий для нових починань.",Новини Відео Про нас,

Bottom Line
Although spider veins don’t pose any health issues, you may want to remove them for cosmetic reasons. Sclerotherapy is the most popular treatment for spider veins, but laser therapy is another effective way to remove them.

Spider veins, or telangiectasias, are visible, tiny blood vessels mostly found in your legs.

Laser treatment for spider veins involves targeting the vein directly with a beam of light, which causes blood clots to form that block off and destroy the veins. Laser therapy is the second mostTrusted Source popular option to treat spider veins.

In some cases, a combination of laser treatment and sclerotherapy may be best to remove veins completely. Here’s what to know.","About Us

How Valentine, Head of Marketing at Fleet, Uses Dust
Founded in 2019, Fleet is a unique IT equipment management company enabling users to rent, manage, secure, and renew their entire IT device fleet from a single platform. 

Earlier this year Fleet added a fresh face to their team, taking on SEO specialist Valentine Chelius as their new Head of Marketing. Coming from several years working exclusively in SEO, Valentine faced the challenge of rapidly adjusting to a significantly broader role at Fleet. At the time of her hiring, Fleet’s marketing team was decidedly small. All at once, she became responsible for creating new internal structures in addition to keeping up with various ongoing marketing tasks. ","Product Updates

Hair Loss Treatments in Mangalore
Blogs
December 19, 2024
Did you know we shed about 50–100 hairs daily? This is completely normal because they naturally grow back. But you’ll be surprised to know that – by the age of 20, 20 percent of men experience hair loss that doesn’t grow back, which isn’t normal!

When you lose more hair and don’t see the replaced ones growing, it’s a clear sign of thinning hair or bald patches, which we call hair loss.

People suffering from hair loss have adverse psychological effects that affect both males and females.

Let’s understand this with the help of an illustration: Baldness causes depression, social isolation, and self-esteem. In addition, women are more emotionally impacted by hair loss than men.

To beat this issue, we have several hair loss treatments in Mangalore that could give you better results in terms of hair growth. But before that, you must understand the cause of hair loss.","Copyright © 2025 by The Skin Clinic.

Produktbeskrivning
Ända sedan han greps i Israel 1979 har namnet Stig Bergling varit synonymt med spioneri. Han har utmålats som en storspion och särling. En kvinnornas man, gift många gånger men aldrig med sitt livs stora kärlek. Gång på gång gäckade han den svenska rättvisan, inte minst genom den spektakulära rymningen oktober 1987.
Men var spionen Stig Bergling egentligen så framgångsrik? Vem tjänade på hans eskapader, och vem offrades för att han skulle gå fri? Jonas Bonniers skickligt konstruerade roman utmanar myten Bergling och bjuder på ett hisnande äventyr i den bisarra värld som agenter lever och verkar i.

Autism and Stigma
Introduction to Autism Stigma
Autism stigma is a complex and multifaceted issue that deeply affects autistic individuals and their families. Deep-seated misconceptions and lack of understanding lead to widespread discrimination, social exclusion, and a host of mental health challenges for those on the spectrum. Societal perceptions of autism often result in negative stereotypes, fueling stigmatizing attitudes and behaviors. This article delves into various aspects of autism stigma, exploring its roots, impacts, and the ongoing efforts to combat it. By examining personal experiences, societal attitudes, and educational strategies, we aim to shed light on how stigma can be addressed and ultimately reduced.","Home

The latest Market Talks covering Financial Services. Exclusively on Dow Jones Newswires at 4:20 ET, 12:20 ET and 16:50 ET.

1423 ET – New York state home sales rose in December, even as the state’s housing inventory reached its lowest point in recorded history, the New York State Association of Realtors says. Closed sales in the state rose 3.7% from December 2023, while pending sales were also up, from 6,207 homes in December 2023 to 6,423 homes in 2024, the association says. The median sales price rose 10.5% in December, from $380,000 in December 2023 to $420,000. U.S. home sales dropped to their lowest level since 1995 last year, as mortgage rates and costs related to home ownership stayed high. (stephen.nakrosis@wsj.com)","WSJ Membership

New Delhi, Apr 19 (PTI) Cases involving ""influential"" persons deserve ""special focus"" to avoid long delays in investigation and trial, but at the same time any blanket direction to set up special courts whenever such personalities are involved should be avoided, the Law Commission has said. The panel also said that though there could be special focus on the criminal cases involving ""influential public men"", the steps to be taken should be part of the ""larger plan"" to check delays and deficiencies in investigation into serious crimes and to ensure progress of trials without hindrances and hurdles placed by the accused. ""The Commission is of the view that the cases of influential persons in public life need to come up for special focus for the reason that the experience shows occurrence of long delays both in investigation and trial...,"" the Commission has said in its latest report dealing with 'expeditious investigation and trial of criminal cases against influential public personalities'. The panel, which advises government on complex legal issues, said persons holding public offices have a role to play in democratic governance and the people have legitimate expectation that the elected representatives are clean and free from criminal misconduct. ""Thus, public are equally interested in early conclusion of trial. The cloud cast on them should not linger on for years and decades,"" it said. On the question of setting up of special courts to try such personalities, the report pointed that creation of more special courts to deal with corruption cases is an area which is engaging the attention of the Centre and the high courts. ""Crimes allegedly committed by influential persons holding high offices in extraordinary situations such as Emergency was held to be a justifiable ground to set up Special Courts. But, any blanket direction to set up Special Courts wherever influential public personalities are involved ought to be avoided, especially viewed from Article 14 angle,"" (which deals with equality before law) the report said.

363,https://fleetdm.com/announcements/introducing-orbit-your-fleet-agent-manager,"Introducing Orbit, your Fleet agent manager  We’re pleased to announce that Orbit is out of beta and in v1!

Orbit is an agent manager. It installs and updates Fleet’s agents on your end-user hosts (currently osquery and Fleet Desktop). Rather than doing all that manually, you can rely on Orbit, which regularly checks your Fleet instance for the latest desired setup and changes the agents on the host to match your specification. With Orbit, you can stop juggling osquery vs. Fleet Desktop vs. some other agent in your head.

How do I install Orbit on my hosts?
Orbit can be installed on your hosts with an installer package, which can be generated using the fleetctl package command. Once generated, run the installer on the host to start the install. The package can also be delivered at scale using an enterprise deployment tool like Munki. Read our doc on adding hosts to learn more about generating the package and installing Orbit.

The iPhone 16 Pro Max, on the other hand, brings Apple's latest silicon, a few minor camera tweaks, and some endurance improvements. So which one is better?

Human activity, including climate change that results in extreme drought, contributes to the increased risk, frequency, and intensity of forest and peat fires. Human activity can directly cause forest fires for a variety of reasons.


Our Approach to Fire Management and Prevention

Within these three domains, we analyze and manage fire risk, monitor fires, and conduct assessments according to the elements in Figure 1 on the left:

Ramsey School District

May 28, 2025

What's happening: Tisdale School recently had a very special visit from three therapy dogs. One in particular was a friendly golden retriever named Ziggy. Therapy dog by day, lap dog at night - Ziggy and golden retrievers in general are known for friendliness, affection and loyalty. 🐾

Why it matters: These moments create natural opportunities to normalize conversations about emotional wellbeing with students. Just as therapy dogs provide comfort without judgment, we want our school community to understand that seeking support when we're feeling sad, worried, or overwhelmed is a sign of strength, not weakness.

What they’re saying:

“It was a wonderful opportunity to meet Ziggy, CJ, and Cody. The students loved petting them and learning how therapy dogs help people feel safe, calm, and comforted.” - Jeanne Sullivan, Tisdale School Preschool Teacher

Go deeper: Tisdale students discovered how therapy comes in many forms - sometimes it's talking with a counselor, and other times it's the simple comfort of a gentle companion. We're teaching our students early that it's okay to need help, and that asking for it is brave.

The bottom line: The smiles and open conversations sparked by these furry visitors remind us that creating comfortable, stigma-free environments is essential for children to feel safe expressing their feelings and seeking support when needed. ","DISTRICT ANTI-BULLYING COORDINATOR

When creating data flows in Coalesce, it's common to need to filter or limit data from an upstream node before passing it downstream. For example, selecting only the latest records or a subset of columns.

It's important to understand that nodes don't actively push data to downstream nodes. Instead, nodes are queried by consumers via SQL SELECT statements that stitch together the data flow graph.

This means any row limiting logic needs to be applied in consuming nodes, not publishing nodes.

Best Practice: Filter in Consuming Node in Join
The proper way is to place a WHERE condition in consuming node JOIN clause.

SELECT * 
FROM MyNode
WHERE RowNum = 1

Now only row 1 will be created in the database object defined by the node.

Not Recommended: Filtering in Publishing Node
You CANNOT do this, for example in Post SQL.

SELECT * FROM MyNode WHERE RowNum = 1

This won’t actually filter what data reaches subsequent nodes.

388,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_vehicle_lighting,"Emergency vehicle lighting Emergency vehicle lighting, also known as simply emergency lighting or emergency lights, is a type of vehicle lighting used to visually announce a vehicle's presence to other road users. A sub-type of emergency vehicle equipment, emergency vehicle lighting is generally used by emergency vehicles and other authorized vehicles in a variety of colors.

Emergency vehicle lighting refers to any of several visual warning devices, which may be known as lightbars or beacons, fitted to a vehicle and used when the driver wishes to convey to other road users the urgency of their journey, to provide additional warning of a hazard when stationary, or in the case of law enforcement as a means of signalling another motorist that a traffic stop is being initiated. These lights may be dedicated emergency lights, such as a beacon or a lightbar, or modified stock lighting, such as a wig-wag or hideaway light, and are additional to any standard lighting on the car such as hazard lights. They are often used along with a siren system to increase their effectiveness and provide audible warnings alongside the visual warnings produced by the lights.","History

There are very few pieces of beauty wisdom that all the experts agree upon, but the importance of sun protection is a rare exception. Dermatologists are adamant that people should wear sunscreen every day, regardless of the season, to protect skin from harmful UV rays that can cause sunburn, premature aging and skin cancer. An SPF of 30 or higher is typically recommended for daily use and is especially important on your face because facial skin is more delicate, more frequently exposed to the sun, and more prone to visible sun damage and skin cancer.

About Model Profiles
The models for NVIDIA NIM microservices use model engines that are tuned for specific NVIDIA GPU models, number of GPUs, precision, and so on. NVIDIA produces model engines for several popular combinations and these are referred to as model profiles. Each model profile is identified by a unique 64-character string of hexadecimal digits that is referred to as a profile ID.

The NIM microservices support automatic profile selection by determining the GPU model and count on the node and attempting to match the optimal model profile. Alternatively, NIM microservices support running a specified model profile, but this requires that you review the profiles and know the profile ID.

The available model profiles are stored in a file in the NIM container file system. The file is referred to as the model manifest file and the default path is /opt/nim/etc/default/model_manifest.yaml in the container.

Hive AI Generated Image Detection Model Profiles
Hive’s AI-Generated Image Detection model is optimized for use with the kind of media generated by popular AI generative engines such as DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion.",Privacy Policy | Manage My Privacy | Do Not Sell or Share My Data | Terms of Service | Accessibility | Corporate Policies | Product Security | Contact,

Neurons in the shape of a pyramid

Pyramidal neurons are neural cells found in nearly all mammals’ cerebral cortexes, as well as in birds, fish, and reptiles. They are also common in subcortical structures like the hippocampus and the amygdala. They got their name due to their specific teardrop or rounded pyramid shape.

The structure of these cells looks like a tree. The body of these neurons is called soma and resembles the tree base. Multiple extensions called dendrites grow from the soma, just like roots. On the other end, a singular long extension called an axon resides like a tall tree trunk with little branches at the top. The dendrites, covered in small protrusions called dendritic spines, receive signals from other neurons. On the other hand, the axon sends signals to other neurons. Such a structure allows pyramidal neurons to form complex communication networks within the brain like a forest, allowing us to learn and create memories (1, 2).","Help

发布于：四川省
当前65%企业面临知识孤岛导致的决策延迟问题。AI技术正从概念验证转向生产环境部署，本文基于300+企业实施案例，提炼可复用的知识管理升级路径。2025年，企业正加速迈入人工智能主导的知识管理新时代。面对技术变革和市场压力，知识管理成为支撑企业稳定增长与持续创新的关键力量。在AI技术的赋能下，知识不仅用于存储，更成为驱动业务发展的智能引擎。



关键词一：知识增强生成，打造“可思考”的知识系统
人工智能改变了企业获取与应用知识的方式。KAG（Knowledge Augmented Generation）技术融合大语言模型与企业内部知识库，通过语义理解和深度生成，构建出“具备推理能力”的智能知识系统。

相比传统静态知识库，KAG具备三大优势：

语义增强：结合知识图谱，实现更精准的内容匹配。
实时生成：动态生成业务所需答案，提升响应速度。
智能推荐：基于上下文理解，主动推送相关信息。
通过KAG技术，企业不再仅依赖检索式知识获取，而是拥有了一个“会思考”的知识助手。

关键词二：场景化应用，实现知识与业务深度融合
企业的知识应用效率与业务场景的契合度密切相关。场景化知识管理通过精准匹配使用情境，使知识转化为实际生产力。典型行业案例包括：

零售行业：基于销售数据推荐商品陈列方案，优化补货节奏，提升门店销售转化。
制造行业：系统推送设备操作指南与维护建议，提升生产稳定性与工人技能水平。
客服行业：知识库结合用户历史数据，快速推荐个性化解决方案，提升客户满意度。
通过场景化知识部署，企业构建了从信息获取到实际执行的闭环路径。",新闻体育汽车房产旅游教育时尚科技财经娱乐更多,

AI dev platform Hugging Face has acquired Pollen Robotics, a robotics startup based in France, for an undisclosed amount. Wired reports that Hugging Face plans to sell Pollen’s humanoid robot, Reachy 2, and let developers download and suggest improvements to its code.

Pollen Robotics, which aims to bring affordable humanoid robots to the home, was founded in 2016 by Matthieu Lapeyre and Pierre Rouanet. The company managed to raise €2.5 million (around $2.83 million) from investors, including Bpifrance, prior to its exit, according to Crunchbase.



The acquisition marks an expansion of Hugging Faces’ robotics efforts, with which Pollen was closely involved. Last year, Hugging Face teamed up with Pollen to build “Le Robot,” an open source robot trained to do a variety of household chores. Hugging Face also established a robotics team led by Remi Cadene, a former robotics engineer from Tesla’s Optimus program.","

Good day to all readers, developers and other players. I am a big fan of the Frank Herbert book saga and I am looking forward to the release of this project with great hopes.

My question arose while watching numerous presentations of the combat system from developers from Funcom. I am very surprised that ballistic weapons quite often destroy the energy shields of characters, despite the Holtzman effect described in the books, and weapons that shoot darts turn into ordinary submachine guns, destroying shields on the same principle as other weapons.

I understand that this is one of the elements of the game's balance, but I have a feeling that the shooters in the new Dune game will become a meta very quickly.

Dear developers, please pay attention to this, because it's not for nothing that people in Herbert's world prefer edged weapons to firearms.

PS: Considering that using a shield in the deserts of Arrakis is dangerous for your life, shooters can occupy advantageous positions and arrange so-called shooting in vast territories. Consider this, among other things, when creating a balance among the game classes.","All

Building and maintaining healthy relationships is an integral part of human life. Forming bonds with others and having a sense of belonging is proven to have a positive impacton our emotional and cognitive wellbeing. 

Our ability to have stable, long lasting relationships can be impacted by any number of things, from negative past experiences to mental illness to trauma to stress. Relationships take work and self-awareness, and sometimes we might need help from a trained professional to maintain strength in our interpersonal connections with others.

Those who are in a romantic relationship might seek out couples or marriage therapy to work on improving communication skills or other issues that are impacting their cohesive unit. However, partners don’t always have the same therapy goals, the issues affecting a relationship are sometimes more individual, or you might not be in a romantic situation at all and want advice about improving your ability to have healthy relationships in general. It is entirely possible to “work on a relationship” in individual therapy.

A therapist who specializes in relationships will look at underlying issues that are affecting your relationship with yourself, friends, family, coworkers, or romantically (whether or not you’re currently seeing someone). ","Company

Aura's Carver, Buddy, and Gallerie (Costco-exclusive) frame models are designed with landscape-optimized (wide) screens and offer a unique feature called ""Photo Match."" By default, this feature is activated to dynamically pair two portrait photos side by side, maximizing the use of the expansive landscape display. Please note that the pairing of photos is done randomly to create delightful combinations. Unfortunately, manual selection of paired photos is not supported. This behavior remains consistent regardless of whether the frame is set to shuffle or chronological mode. ","Browse

England likely need to beat Afghanistan on Wednesday and South Africa on Saturday to avoid a group-stage exit at the Champions Trophy.

Were they to go out, it would be England's third disappointing global event since Buttler led them to the T20 World Cup title in 2022.

""He's doing so much right on the field, making good decisions and creating a really good environment for us to thrive in,"" Root said.

""He's a brilliant leader. He's the best white-ball player we've ever produced and he's got the full support of everyone within our dressing room to keep doing and keep bringing everything that he's brought so far to this team.""","Terms of Use

From creative arts to mindful practices, here are 11 new hobbies to try at home that cater to a range of interests and skill levels.

Whether you’re stitching in your cozy apartment in Phoenix, AZ, baking sourdough in your Houston, TX home kitchen, or journaling in a snug corner of your New Orleans, LA rental, these new hobbies to try at home will keep you inspired all year long.

1. Sewing and fabric arts
“Make your space your home with some simple sewing projects,” suggests Penny from online fabric store, Gala Fabrics. Sewing is a versatile and creative outlet that also exercises your brain. Penny recommends starting with toss cushions or curtains to customize your decor. For a unique touch, try the Japanese boro stitching technique, which combines utility and artistry. “It’s a form of self-expression with fancy stitches and colorful threads,” she explains. “Starter kits, available online, make it easy to begin your sewing journey.”

Amanda Farrell, owner of Embroidered Panda in Palm Coast, FL, offering custom pieces, adds, “Try sashiko, a striking Japanese hand-sewing technique to repair or embellish clothing. It’s both sustainable and artistic. With just a needle and thread, this centuries-old embroidery technique strengthens and adorns fabric, giving new life to old clothes.”","Chef's Corner

Brut Estate Cuveé
This brut cuvée speaks to this place. One of the first vineyards planted on our Elm Valley Estate. Many of the vines are own rooted, planted in the early 1980's. Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Pinot Gris and Vignoles and subtle oak are supported by crisp acidity and carefully aged fruit. Production Notes

Grapes are hand picked and whole cluster pressed in the fall. Only cuvee fractions are used for this product. The juice is fermented in stainless steel after settling. 33% Solera reserve wines are added during fermentation. These reserve wines consist of wines made from grapes harvested from this vineyard every year since 1993. Reserve wines are drawn off for blending the next year. The wine is filtered and then tirage bottled during the winter/spring the following year. Our brut estate cuveé wine is then aged for approximately 4 years en tirage until it is riddled, and disgorged.

The beautiful foliage resembles that of a real fern, and on top of that, the soft pink flowers appear. Plant the Incarvillea about 5 cm deep and about 10 cm apart. Plant several together for a beautiful, full effect in your garden. At the end of autumn, cover with some garden waste, and the Flowering Garden Fern will be completely winter-ready.","Assortment

438,http://saprea.org/stories/alone-scared,"I Felt Alone, Scared, and Unable to Get Help
 ;
At the very young age of four, a family member began sexually abusing me. I felt trapped, worthless, disgusting, and broken. For years my abuse went on with no stop to it. I felt alone and scared and unable to get help from anyone. My abuser had convinced me that if I came forward, no one would believe me, no one would listen, and even worse, he would harm me and my brother. I was stuck. For years I had held onto this emotional pain. 

Finally, as a 16-year-old, I came forward about my abuse to my family. Lucky for me, my family was incredibly accepting and supportive. They all had my back. However, healing from sexual abuse is not a one-step process. It takes a lifetime of support and finding yourself again. It takes effort and time to accept. 

A year ago, I made the best decision of my entire life. I attended the Saprea Retreat in Utah. Although this was the scariest step I had ever taken in my journey, I knew deep down that this retreat is what I needed, and I was right. I met women from all over the country who knew exactly how I was feeling and how I was struggling. These women, and the incredible volunteers and staff, changed my life forever. Through the activities and bonding, the tears and the smiles, I gained HOPE! Something I never really had before this retreat. I realized my worth, I realized I was not alone, and I realized that I would survive! I would thrive! And I would be okay. I am so grateful for this experience and will never forget the amazing women who changed my life.

Parc naturel régional depuis 2013
Le Parc naturel régional Jura vaudois s’étend du sommet de La Dôle jusqu’à Romainmôtier. Des villages du Pied du Jura à la Vallée de Joux, en passant par les crêtes ou ses trois cols, il offre des paysages typiques et une nature préservée. Son patrimoine, ses traditions vivantes et son terroir en font une région de caractère.

Harmonieuse diversité
Le Parc naturel régional Jura vaudois, c'est 40'500 habitants et 35 communes réunies par une même volonté sur un territoire de 574 km2. Ici, épicéas et murs de pierres sèches dessinent un paysage typique : celui des pâturages boisés. Alternant avec des massifs forestiers, comme le Risoud, ils reflètent l'activité sylvopastorale qui caractérise la région. Plus de 200 chalets d'alpage ponctuent le territoire. Lieux d'accueil touristique parfois, ils sont encore dédiés à l'économie alpestre et à la fabrication du fromage. Les spécialités du terroir en témoignent.  ","

Body weight can be a sensitive topic. After all, it’s often directly tied to things like body image, self-esteem and mental health. But asking yourself, “How much should I weigh?” can be an important step in taking control of and improving your health. The numbers on the scale don’t define you, but they can cause some major health concerns. Read on to learn about body mass index (BMI) and when to see a doctor.

What is BMI and why does it matter?
BMI is your weight in pounds (lbs) divided by height in inches (in) squared then multiplied by a conversation factor of 703. This measures your body fat relative to how tall you are to help determine possible risk of weight-related health problems, like type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular disease.1","Contact us

The Appeal 
In the classic car world, is there any car quite as fun and care-free as a Herald convertible? These rugged, unassuming four-seat drop tops are a joy to drive - and be driven in. 
This one proves the point with its dashing side stripe and purposeful Minilite-style alloys. Finished in petrol blue it is a very tidy and usable example of these simple and dependable classics. It benefits from a full engine rebuild and is said to run and drive exceptionally well. 
With a full four seats, decent sized boot and even a tow bar and luggage rack into the bargain, this is a great example of Triumph’s ever-popular classic. ","4x4s

2023-10-28   09:50:36 来源：海南日报 字体： 小 中 大 分享到：
  “不臭了，还能闻到青草香气。”10月26日，经过一个月的时间，澄迈县金江镇城东社区王宅村村民张山终于不用再捂着鼻子快速跑过这片水塘，反而能慢下脚步，看看多年未见的风景。

  踱步间，张山身后传来阵阵讨论声。“还是得给村民们建散步休闲的栈道，种些花草也漂亮。”说话的是城东社区党支部书记王孟，这片7亩大的荒废鱼塘，是他这多年来的心病。

  “终于不臭了”是村民对黑臭水体治理的肯定，也是对主题教育中“办实事、解民忧”的积极回应。

  农村生活污水治理是关乎群众切身利益的民生工程，也是自第二批学习贯彻习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想主题教育开展以来，澄迈县聚焦的民生热点之一。澄迈各有关部门党员干部围绕提升农村人居环境，深入调研、摸准问题，因地制宜、分类施策，让治理成果更多、更好地惠及群众。

  长期工作在基层一线的王孟知道，“水体黑臭”现象在水里，根子在岸上。

  “鱼塘荒废已久，村民们图方便，便将污水排放管放入塘内，一年两年问题不大，但积年累月，水体失去自身净化能力，便愈加发臭，滋生蚊虫。”王孟告诉海南日报记者，如今，通过截污控源将全村400余户的污水，接入全县的排污管，阻止了污水进入水塘。

  同时，该社区还与澄迈县水务部门协作，利用抽水机将黑臭污水全部排尽，再配合挖掘机，将塘底淤泥全部清理后，灌入清水。

  “环境好了，村民也不再抱怨了。”王孟说，为持续改善生态环境，下一步还将放入荷花苗为水塘增色。","澄迈加快农村生活污水治理 污水变清流 映照好环境

Abstract
Decision-making agents based on pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed across various domains of human activity. While their applications are currently rather specialized, several research efforts are underway to develop more generalist agents. As LLM-based systems become more agentic, their influence on human activity will grow and their transparency will decrease. Consequently, developing effective methods for aligning them to human values is vital.

The prevailing practice in alignment often relies on human preference data (e.g., in RLHF or DPO), in which values are implicit, opaque and are essentially deduced from relative preferences over different model outputs. In this work, instead of relying on human feedback, we introduce the design of reward functions that explicitly and transparently encode core human values for Reinforcement Learning-based fine-tuning of foundation agent models. Specifically, we use intrinsic rewards for the moral alignment of LLM agents.",,

* فيتامين د والتصلب المتعدد
أشارت دراسة أجراها باحثون في جامعة أكسفورد وأخرى أجريت في كلية نيو جيرسي للطب، أن الحفاظ على مستويات مناسبة من فيتامين ""د"" له تأثير وقائي ضد خطر الإصابة بالتصلب المتعدد.
​
كما أشارت دراسة أخرى أجريت في جامعة ماستريخت في هولندا، وغيرها من الدراسات، إلى أن فيتامين ""د"" قد يقلل من وتيرة أعراض التصلب المتعدد وشدتها، وذلك للأشخاص المصابين بالفعل بهذه الحالة، ويحتاج الأمر إلى المزيد من البحث لتقييم هذه النتائج.
* الجهاز المناعي والتصلب المتعدد
عند إصابة الشخص بالتصلب المتعدد، فإن الجهاز المناعي يهاجم الغلاف الذي يحمي الخلايا العصبية. وتشير البحوث إلى أن العلاقة بين فيتامين ""د"" والتصلب المتعدد يمكن أن تكون مرتبطة بالآثار الإيجابية لفيتامين ""د"" على الجهاز المناعي.
* أشعة الشمس والتصلب المتعدد
جدير بالذكر، أن العلاقة بين فيتامين ""د"" والتصلب المتعدد يعززها الارتباط بين أشعة الشمس وخطر التصلب المتعدد؛ فكلما كان الشخص مقيمًا بعيدًا عن خط الاستواء، ارتفع خطر الإصابة بالتصلب المتعدد، فضوء الشمس هو مصدر الجسم الأكثر كفاءة لفيتامين ""د""، مما يشير إلى أن التعرض لأشعة الشمس يمكن أن يقي من التصلب المتعدد.","من نحن ؟

原标题：知识史研究的兴起及意义


古登堡印刷术的发明，降低了印刷品的成本，使得知识传播也更为方便。资料图片

作者：陈恒，系上海师范大学世界史系教授

知识史在西方的兴起

知识的概念犹如文化，见仁见智，难以有一个大家广泛认同的定义。当代学术界似乎并没有把知识研究视为一个领域，也很少视知识史为一个新兴学科，至多将其看作是学术史、思想史、史学史、科学史、阅读史等领域的文献集成而已。

西方世界最早关心知识问题的是苏格拉底、柏拉图、亚里士多德、奥古斯丁等思想家。文艺复兴时代哲学家培根在《学术的进步》（1605）中系统地探讨了知识问题。到了近代，社会学家也开始关心知识问题，出现了以马克斯·韦伯、卡尔·曼海姆、马克斯·舍勒等人为代表的德国知识研究传统，如韦伯将官僚制定义为“以知识为基础而进行控制的实践”；以奥古斯特·孔德、埃米尔·涂尔干、马塞尔·莫斯、米歇尔·福柯为代表的法国知识研究传统，如孔德所提出的知识社会的“无名史”；以培根、霍布斯、洛克、贝克莱、大卫·休谟、柯林伍德等人为代表的英国知识研究传统，如培根认为“一个有恒心勇于奉献的学者，应有志于增加本学科的知识”；以托斯丹·凡勃仑、罗伯特·默顿、托马斯·库恩等人为代表的美国知识研究传统，如凡勃仑特别关注社会群体与知识制度之间的关系。",主管主办：全国哲学社会科学工作办公室 承办：人民网,

Schmidt）研制成回弹仪；1949 年莱斯利（Leslie）等人用超声脉冲成功检测混凝土；60 年代费格瓦洛（I. Facaoaru）提出用声速、回弹综合法估算混凝土强度；80 年代中期，美国的Mary Sansalone 等用机械波反射法进行混凝土无损检测；90 年代以来，随着科学技术的快速发展，涌现出一批新的测试方法，如微波吸收、雷达扫描、红外线谱、脉冲回波等方法。我国从50年代开始引进瑞士、英国、波兰等国的超声波仪器和回弹仪，并结合工程应用开展了一定的研究工作；60 年代初我国研制成功多种型号的超声波仪器，随后广泛进行了混凝土无损检测技术的研究和应用；80 年代混凝土无损检测技术在我国得到快速发展,"室内空气质量的检测意义

It doesn't really matter as long as you always use the same account. Logging into Gearset is all done via OAuth, using one of your existing Salesforce, Google, or LinkedIn accounts.

 

The account you use to log into Gearset is only used to create your Gearset user profile. If you log in using a Salesforce account, we won't deploy to this org or read the metadata from it (unless you separately add it as an org connection). We also don't see or store your user credentials (e.g. password) - that is all held by either Salesforce or Google and securely managed via the OAuth process.

 

Pick an account you're likely to remember using, and one that won't be deleted. You'll use this account every time you want to log into Gearset.","Starting a free trial and creating your Gearset account

Scholars from Renmin University argue that China is particularly vulnerable to supply shocks and rising prices for agricultural commodities triggered by the Ukraine war. A volatile and challenging geopolitical outlook, the authors suggest, represents a long-term risk for China’s food security. The authors call on Beijing to diversify sourcing of China’s food supply (including away from the United States) by encouraging greater Chinese investment in the Russian agricultural sector and pursuing trade agreements with a wider range of partners.",Interpret: China is a CSIS project aimed at facilitating a more nuanced understanding of global strategic issues through a library of translated materials matched with expert commentary.,

10 Essential Skills Every Pharmacist Must Have


Pharmacists play a crucial role in the healthcare system, ensuring patients receive the right medications, proper guidance, and ongoing care. To excel in this profession, pharmacists must possess a blend of technical knowledge, interpersonal skills, and adaptability. Here are the 10 essential skills every pharmacist must have to thrive in their career.

1. Every Pharmacist Must Have Attention to Detail
Pharmacists must be meticulous when dispensing medications, checking prescriptions, and ensuring accuracy. Even a small error can have serious consequences for patient safety. As a result, pharmacists need to maintain a high level of focus to prevent mistakes and ensure the best possible care.

2. Communication Skills
Clear communication is key for pharmacists. They must explain medication usage, potential side effects, and interact with other healthcare professionals. Therefore, being able to convey complex information in a simple and concise manner is vital for patient safety and collaboration with the medical team.","

5 steps to boost sales performance with opportunity management
1. Identify opportunities
2. Analyze and qualify opportunities
3. Plan and execute 
4. Manage opportunities for the long term
5. Analyze results
Schedule your demo
Leads, opportunities, sales: That’s the natural sequence of the sales process, right?

But opportunities can be much more than that.

All you need to do is zoom out, see the bigger picture and start looking for long-term growth and expansion possibilities rather than focusing only on short-term conversion objectives.

Below, we’ll discuss the impact that a robust opportunity management process can have on your bottom line.

Key takeaways
Opportunity management is not exactly the same as lead management, although the two processes are similar. Lead management focuses on achieving sales goals in the short to medium term, while opportunity management is more about leveraging strategic relationships to achieve long-term growth goals.
Automation is fundamental to building a robust sales pipeline; document management tools fused with CRM software accelerate this process.
Opportunity management relies on building strong relationships, so relationship building is central to your success.","eSignatures

We all know excess spin and friction is a killer of driving the golf ball, so when a company claims to have a golf tee that helps to eliminate these, I must give them a try. The company is Graavee, and their offer some unique golf tees, called Zero Gravi- Tee friction free golf tees. The golf tees have a unique shape and look to them and are like nothing I have ever seen before. So, what makes the Graavee Zero Gravi-Tees work so well unlike all others, here’s what the company says… Zero Friction – Zero Gravi-Tees removes friction entirely Zero Added Spin – Zero Gravi-Tees design eliminates ball contact Zero Ball Influence – Zero Gravi-Tees holds your ball securely but without interference Also, according to the company, robotic testing has conclusively proven that Zero Gravi-Tees provide up to 22 yards of slice protection, representing a significant advancement in shot accuracy, a straighter shot with unwanted spin equals longer drives. I have been using the Gravi-Tees now for almost a month and as unusual as they look, they are very long, and very straight! I [&#8230;]

Serving our diverse student body
We are excited to share that Denny Crum Hall opened its doors in Fall 2022. The 128-bed facility houses a mixture of student-athletes and non-student-athletes, including those admitted to one of our new living-learning and themed communities. It is located directly opposite the Planet Fitness Kueber Center along South Floyd Street.

Expanding our residential community
Overall, the new hall enables us to enhance the quality of support and services which we offer to our diverse student population. A large part of that project will involve showcasing the support and sense of community created by our live-in staff. The new hall hosts three resident assistants (RAs) and a full-time professional hall director. It also hosts our Sport Professions LLC for second-year students.

The Sport Professions LLC provides students across all majors with a unique opportunity to immerse themselves in the sport industry. Members have an “inside” look into the UofL Athletic Department with access to senior leaders and sport performance, creative services, compliance, student development professionals and more! Additionally, members have the opportunity to meet and network with other sport organizations in Louisville and nationally, including Racing Louisville/LouCity, Louisville Bats, Louisville Sports Commission, and Excel Sport Management. Students also gain access to our extensive alumni network of sport professionals around the US. There are also opportunities for numerous volunteer experiences, social events, and career development activities including resume review and mock interviews. If you have an interest in working in the sport industry – this is where you need to be!

The state-of-the-art facility will benefit our university's ongoing recruitment and retention efforts and serve as yet another step in our progressive campus development.

The residence hall features the following:

Apartment-style
Primarily 2X2 units, limited 1X1 units
Queen(60” x 80”) beds in all rooms

Summary
What are electrolytes?
Electrolytes are minerals that have an electric charge when they are dissolved in water or body fluids, including blood. The electric charge can be positive or negative. You have electrolytes in your blood, urine (pee), tissues, and other body fluids.

Electrolytes are important because they help:

Balance the amount of water in your body
Balance your body's acid/base (pH) level
Move nutrients into your cells
Move wastes out of your cells
Support your muscle and nerve function
Keep your heart rate and rhythm steady
Keep your blood pressure stable
Keep your bones and teeth healthy
What are the different types of electrolytes in your body?
The main electrolytes in your body include:

Bicarbonate, which helps maintain the body's acid and base balance (pH). It also plays an important role in moving carbon dioxide through the bloodstream.
Calcium, which helps make and keep bones and teeth strong.
Chloride, which also helps control the amount of fluid in the body. In addition, it helps maintain healthy blood volume and blood pressure.
Magnesium, which helps your muscles, nerves, and heart work properly. It also helps control blood pressure and blood glucose (blood sugar).
Phosphate, which works together with calcium to build strong bones and teeth.
Potassium, which helps your cells, heart, and muscles work properly.
Sodium, which helps control the amount of fluid in the body. It also helps your nerves and muscles work properly.","MedlinePlus Trusted Health Information for You

This is a complete guide to the WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) in 2025.

If you’ve just started delving into your web accessibility compliance journey, you will no doubt have come across mentions of WCAG.

WCAG is what all global disability acts are based on when it comes to web accessibility, which means it’s essential to have an in-depth understanding of these requirements. Doing so can enhance the inclusivity of your site and help you avoid lawsuits and fines, which start from $55,000 to $150,000.

Let’s dive in.

We will talk about
What is the W3C
WAI – Web Accessibility Initiative
The WCAG
WCAG Worldwide: Legal Obligations Per Country
Key Takeaways
Global disability acts like the ADA, AODA, and the EAA refer to WCAG when outlining their web accessibility standards and requirements.
WCAG is based on four core principles. Content must be Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust.
There are three different compliance levels associated with WCAG, namely Level A, AA, and AAA. Level AA is what most businesses should strive to achieve.
The latest version of the guidelines is WCAG 2.2.
Accessibility is a legal requirement in many regions and failure to adhere to the WCAG guidelines can result in costly fines, lawsuits, and brand damage.","Solutions

Couchbase

v1.20.x (latest)
Couchbase database secrets engine
Note

This engine can use external X.509 certificates as part of TLS or signature validation. Verifying signatures against X.509 certificates that use SHA-1 is deprecated and is no longer usable without a workaround starting in Vault 1.12. Refer to the deprecation notices for more information.

Couchbase is one of the supported plugins for the database secrets engine. This plugin generates database credentials dynamically based on configured roles for the Couchbase database.

See the database secrets engine docs for more information about setting up the database secrets engine.

Capabilities
Plugin Name	Root Credential Rotation	Dynamic Roles	Static Roles	Username Customization
couchbase-database-plugin	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes (1.7+)
Setup
Enable the database secrets engine if it is not already enabled:

$ vault secrets enable database
Success! Enabled the database secrets engine at: database/

By default, the secrets engine will enable at the name of the engine. To enable the secrets engine at a different path, use the -path argument.

Configure Vault with the proper plugin and connection configuration:

$ vault write database/config/my-couchbase-database \
    plugin_name=""couchbase-database-plugin"" \
    hosts=""couchbase://127.0.0.1"" \
    tls=true \
    base64pem=""${BASE64PEM}"" \
    username=""vaultuser"" \
    password=""vaultpass"" \
    allowed_roles=""my-*-role""

Where ${BASE64PEM} is the server's root certificate authority in PEM format, encoded as a base64 string with no new lines.

To connect to clusters prior to version 6.5.0, a bucket_name must also be configured:

$ vault write database/config/my-couchbase-database \
    plugin_name=""couchbase-database-plugin"" \
    hosts=""couchbase://127.0.0.1"" \
    tls=true \
    base64pem=""${BASE64PEM}"" \
    username=""vaultuser"" \
    password=""vaultpass"" \
    allowed_roles=""my-*-role"" \
    bucket_name=""travel-sample""

You should consider rotating the admin password. Note that if you do, the new password will never be made available through Vault, so you should create a Vault-specific database admin user for this.

5 ways AI will shape businesses in 2025
Dec 17, 2024

Multimodal AI, enhanced enterprise search and more: Be sure to check out all of Google Cloud’s thoughts on how AI will impact businesses this year.

Oliver Parker
Vice President, Global Generative AI Go-To-Market, Google Cloud
Share
From personalized recommendations on your favorite streaming service to AI-powered agents that help you plan your day, artificial intelligence is already changing our lives. And for businesses, it's about to get even bigger: 2025 will be a pivotal year as AI transforms how companies operate, compete and innovate. Today Google Cloud dropped its 2025 AI Business Trends Report — here’s a look at five key trends shaping the future of business.

1. Multimodal AI will deliver more context
Multimodal AI processes information from text, images, audio and video. It allows for more intuitive interactions and significantly improves the accuracy of AI outputs. This human-centric approach to AI is essential for businesses in an increasingly data-rich world. For example, in financial services, this could involve analyzing market commentary videos and considering non-verbal cues, like tone of voice and facial expressions, alongside the spoken words for a more nuanced understanding of market sentiment. In manufacturing, multimodal AI can analyze sensor data like noise and vibrations to proactively address maintenance needs.

2. AI agents will simplify complex tasks
As AI agents become more popular in businesses, they’ll be able to manage complex workflows, automate business processes and support employees. Imagine customer agents providing support with a consistent experience across channels — in person, online and mobile. Employee agents will be able to streamline internal processes; creative agents will enhance design and production skills.

3. Enterprise search will give people the knowledge they need
Enterprise search systems — internal search engines for companies — are no longer limited to keyword-based queries. People will now be able to use images, audio, video and conversational prompts to quickly access and use internal data. Financial institutions can tailor internal knowledge searches to specific employee roles, while retailers can allow customers to find products using natural language and images. In healthcare, AI can power intuitive search that understands complex medical terminology.

4. AI-powered customer experiences will get even better
AI-powered solutions are changing the customer experience, in part by anticipating customer needs and helping businesses stay connected to their customers. This translates to increased revenue, efficiency and brand loyalty. Imagine personalized recommendations and AI-enhanced search that understands customer intent. In retail, AI will be able to create personalized shopping experiences and customer support across all shopping channels — online, in store or mobile. Manufacturers will use AI to improve production and customer service.

5. AI will enhance security systems
In 2025, AI will help bolster defenses, identify and combat threats, automate manual security tasks and accelerate response times. However, this also leads to an ""arms race"" between defenders and attackers, as adversaries leverage AI for more sophisticated attacks. Organizations must proactively address this challenge. Financial institutions can use AI to detect counterfeit documents, and manufacturers can use it to keep data safe and identify potential risks. We also predict that the media and entertainment industry will use AI to combat deepfakes and misinformation.

Point d’étape sur l’Action 7 du plan BEPS de l’OCDE : quels aménagements prévus au statut d’établissement stable à ce stade ?
OCDE – UE 19 juin 2015

Dans le cadre du plan d’action « BEPS », les travaux de l’OCDE visant à aménager la définition de l’établissement stable avancent à grands pas. Il s’agit avant tout de moderniser le concept afin de lui permettre d’attraire en son champ des activités qui, du fait de la rédaction actuelle de l’article 7 du modèle OCDE, soit ne remplissent pas parfaitement les critères requis, soit bénéficient du régime dérogatoire réservé à certains activités spécifiques, alors même qu’elles sont essentielles pour l’entreprise.

Deux grandes catégories de nouveautés sont ainsi attendues. La première concerne les contours de la notion d’agent qui serait redessinés afin d’empêcher le recours artificiel à des contrats de commissionnaires (ou contrats similaires). Quant à la seconde, elle vise à restreindre la portée de l’exception dont bénéficient les activités préparatoires et auxiliaires.

Un premier draft pour commentaires du public avait été publié par l’OCDE le 31 octobre et la réunion de consultation publique s’est tenue le 21 janvier 2015. Puis prenant en comptes les discussions et les échanges auxquels elles ont donné lieu, un second document de travail a été publié le 15 mai dernier. Il expose les options contenues dans le premier draft qui ont été finalement proposées (ces options ne représentent pas- encore – à ce stade un consensus au sein des pays membres de l’OCDE et du G20). Si le public était appelé à commenter ces propositions (jusqu’au 12 juin), il ne donnera pas lieu à une seconde réunion de consultation publique mais les commentaires nouveaux viendront alimentée la dernière réunion du Groupe de Travail idoine se tiendra la semaine du 22 juin. Le rapport final devrait être publié en septembre 2015 et en tous cas avant la fin de l’année 2016, date limite de négociation des instruments multilatéraux qui mettront en application les résultats des travaux sur l’article 7.

Sur les aménagements en vue de lutter contre le recours artificiel aux contrats de commissionnaires (articles 5-5 et 5-6 du modèle OCDE):","Deloitte Société d'Avocats

Hudson Yards West receives critical City Planning approval, advances to City Council review

Apr 09, 2025
City Planning presentation notes the project “will create a dynamic, vibrant and valuable series of buildings and public areas on the Western Railyards site.” Presentation highlights the project’s “seamless pedestrian connectivity” to the High Line and calls the green space an “invaluable amenity” to residents, tenants and the broader local community.
Hudson Yards West, led by Related Companies/Oxford Properties Group and Wynn Resorts, today moved one step closer to final approval after the City Planning Commission overwhelmingly voted in support of modifications required to revitalize the underdeveloped Western Railyards with a gaming resort, housing, green park space, and more.

If approved by City and State officials, Hudson Yards West will deliver transformative quality-of-life improvements for Chelsea, Hell’s Kitchen, and the West Side, while unlocking significant citywide economic opportunity.

Central to the proposal is a community-centered development plan that includes an unprecedented reinvestment model — dedicating 1 percent of gross gaming revenue from the Wynn Resort and Casino to local community organizations so the surrounding neighborhood has a direct stake in the project’s long-term success. The development is also projected to generate $2.7 billion in revenue for the MTA, providing a much-needed boost for public transit at a time of fiscal uncertainty.

In addition to these unique benefits, the project will drive economic and community development because it will:

Generate 5,000 permanent union jobs at Wynn New York City, a world-class resort and gaming facility, plus an additional 35,000 union construction jobs during development
Create 1,500 new housing units, including 324 affordable units
Create a new 5.6-acre green public park
Build a new public K-8 school
Inject $197 million in new investment into local community organizations as part of the project’s first-of-its-kind community benefits plan
In a pre-vote meeting on April 7, the most recent before today’s vote, New York’s Department of City Planning highlighted in a presentation how the proposal will provide “seamless pedestrian connectivity” to the High Line “all the way down to Gansevoort Street in the Meatpacking District.” The presentation also commented that “this proposed open space plan is superior to the one proposed in 2009” because it “provides more green space” for the community. All in all, the City Planning Department determined that Hudson Yards West, with the new zoning modifications, will “create a dynamic, vibrant, and valuable series of buildings and public areas.”

“Today marks a critical milestone for Hudson Yards West: thanks to the collaborative process with City Planning, we are closer than ever to delivering on this historic investment in our community, which will create thousands of new union jobs, thousands of units of new housing, a huge new public green space park and nearly $200 million of community benefits,” said Jeff T. Blau, CEO of Related Companies. “We thank the Commission for thoughtful consideration and feedback throughout this process and look forward to working with City leaders in the coming weeks to ensure we do not miss out on this economic opportunity for New York.”

The vote advances the project to the next and final stage of the City’s Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (ULURP), where the City Council will consider and vote on the proposal within 60 days of today’s approval. If approved by the Council, Hudson Yards West will then be considered by New York State for one of three downstate gaming licenses expected to be awarded by the end of 2025.

The Hudson Yards West proposal will be built on top of the undeveloped western railyards and marks the culmination of a decades-long vision for a revitalization of Hudson Yards. Inclusive of the project’s community benefits plan, the overall project represents a $13 billion investment in New York City and the West Side.

547,https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-15.1.0/libgomp/omp_005fset_005fnested.html,"3.1.9 omp_set_nested – Enable/disable nested parallel regions
Description:
Enable or disable nested parallel regions, i.e., whether team members are allowed to create new teams. The function takes the language-specific equivalent of true and false, where true enables dynamic adjustment of team sizes and false disables it.

Enabling nested parallel regions also sets the maximum number of active nested regions to the maximum supported. Disabling nested parallel regions sets the maximum number of active nested regions to one.

　2015年にリリースされたRustが近年注目されています。RustはMozilla社の社員による個人プロジェクトから始まり、当初はFirefoxなどに使われていました。次第にパフォーマンス、安全性、生産性の高さが評価され、様々なソフトウェアやハードウェアへの組み込み、Webアプリやゲームなどに利用されるようになりました。Webサービスのバックエンド開発にも活用されており、利用を考えている方もいるのではないでしょうか。今回はRustの入門書『バックエンドエンジニアを目指す人のためのRust』（翔泳社）から、なぜRustが注目されているのか、その魅力を紹介します。

　本記事は『バックエンドエンジニアを目指す人のためのRust』（著：安東一慈／大西諒／徳永裕介／中村謙弘／山中雄大）の「第1章　Rustはどういうところで使われているのか？」から抜粋したものです。掲載にあたって編集しています。

Rustとは
　Rustは2015年に正式にリリースされたプログラミング言語です。Mozilla社のGraydon Hoare氏の個人プロジェクトから始まり、同社のウェブブラウザであるFirefoxなどに使われました。

　Rustは近年注目されている言語であり、プログラミングに関する質問を投稿できる海外サイト「Stack Overflow」で開発者向けに毎年行われる「Developer Survey」においてRustを使いたいと考えているユーザーが多いという調査結果が出ています。また、Rustを使っているユーザーのうち「来年も使いたいと考えている」割合が80%を超えています。

　では、Rustはなぜ使いたいと思われているのでしょうか？　理由としては大きく3つあります。

パフォーマンスの高さ
安全性の高さ
生産性の高さ
　それぞれについて解説していきます。

Rustは高パフォーマンス
　Rustはプログラムのメモリ効率や実行速度を非常に重視した言語です。さまざまなプログラミング言語の実行速度を比較した「Benchmark Games」というウェブサイトによると、Rustはほかのプログラミング言語と比べてトップクラスの実行速度であることがわかります。

　では、なぜこれほど実行速度が速いのでしょうか。

In the past two years we doubled down on our investment in developer experience and performance — in every single release we’ve been consistently shipping improvements that multiply their impact when combined together. Seeing the positive community response and increased engagement in our developer events is validating that we’ve been moving in the right direction. Today’s release is bringing a series of improvements that will make it even easier for you to deliver fast web apps with confidence.

A few highlights:

Developer preview of incremental hydration supporting the most performance demanding use cases
Control which routes render on the client, server, or during a build and resolve route parameters during prerendering
Schematics to keep you up to date with the latest best practices — inputs, outputs, queries, inject-based dependency injection, and new build system
Stabilization of core reactivity primitives and introduction of new ones: linkedSignal and resource
Series of quality of life improvements addressing feature requests with more than 2,700 👍 on GitHub! This includes time picker component, unused import removal, running schematics via the language service, HMR for styles, and more!

You can watch a quick overview of the release from our special event video. For a more holistic list of the features and improvements in v19, continue reading below.


Build for speed
Evolving Angular we see the opportunity to enable best performance practices out of the box, so that we can support your performance-sensitive use cases. In the past two years we kicked off a project to enable zoneless Angular, made server-side rendering an integral part of the Angular CLI, and worked closely with Chrome Aurora on hydration and the image directive.

In version 19, we’re elevating Angular server-side rendering to another level with incremental hydration, server route configuration, event replay enabled by default, and more.

Building large web apps increases the amount of JavaScript we ship to the user, which negatively impacts user experience. In v17 we made it trivial to lazily load code with deferrable views for client-side rendered apps. For server-side rendered applications we introduced full-app hydration which requires all the JavaScript associated with a given page to make it interactive. Today, we’re delivering a solution to the server that is inspired by deferrable views!

Welcome incremental hydration in developer preview
Incremental hydration allows you to annotate parts of your template, using already familiar @defer syntax, instructing Angular to load and hydrate them on specific triggers, lazily.

Press enter or click to view image in full size
A demo showing incremental hydration. On the gif there’s an ecommerce website which is server-side rendered. At first everything is grayed out because the app is rendered, but none of the scripts associated with the UI are loaded. When the user engages with the side nav, Angular hydrates this content and changes the color. When the user engages with the items on the page, Angular hydrates the content and removes the grayed out styles.
Incremental hydration demo
The demo above shows incremental hydration in action for a server-side rendered page. There are three visual effects that we’ve added to the demo app code to better illustrate what’s going on:

A component in grayscale filter shows that Angular hasn’t loaded and hydrated it yet
Angular downloads a component from the network when the component starts pulsing
Angular has downloaded and hydrated the component when there’s a purple border around it and the component no longer has a grayscale filter
Additionally, the demo app has an artificial delay of 500ms for each loading operation, so that we can easily explore different states.

Notice that at the beginning everything besides the top bar is grayed out. This means that at this point we have not downloaded any of the JavaScript associated with the page. When the user engages with the filter component at the top left, Angular downloads it (visually indicated by pulsing), and after that hydrates it (demonstrated with the purple glow around the component).

Later on, we continue interacting with the page and incrementally hydrate the rest of the components.

Even without the artificial delay, Angular will download and hydrate the component asynchronously, which means that we have to replay the user event. For this functionality we’re using the event replay functionality we introduced in Angular version 18, which powers Google Search.

When you update to Angular v19, you can try the new incremental hydration in any application that already uses SSR and full application hydration. In your client bootstrap, specify:

import { provideClientHydration, withIncrementalHydration } from '@angular/platform-browser';

// ...
provideClientHydration(withIncrementalHydration());","Help

554,https://globalprotectioncluster.org/sites/default/files/2023-04/Land_Conflicts_Practical_Guide_Dealing_Land_Disputes_2008_EN.pdf,"PREFACE
Land conflicts often have extensive negative effects on economic,
social, spatial and ecological development. This is especially true in
developing countries and countries in transition, where land market
institutions are weak, opportunities for economic gain by illegal action
are widespread and many poor people lack access to land. Land
conflicts can have disastrous effects on individuals as well as on groups
and even entire nations. Many conflicts that are perceived to be clashes
between different cultures are actually conflicts over land and related
natural resources.
In the past, Germany has actively supported international declarations
and action plans which explicitly demand secured access to land –
especially for disadvantaged groups – such as the Habitat II Conference
in Istanbul 1996, World Bank Land Research Conferences from 2001 to
2007, EU Second Forum on Sustainable Rural Development in Africa
2007 etc.
This guide has been written for all those working in the land sector, in
natural resource management and in urban and rural development. It
aims to broaden the understanding of the complexity of causes that lead
to land conflicts in order to provide for better-targeted ways of
addressing such conflicts. It also provides a number of tools with which
to analyse land conflicts. Successful analysis of land conflicts is seen as
a vital step towards their eventual settlement. Finally, this guidebook
discusses a wide variety of options for settling ongoing land conflicts
and for preventing new ones.
In addition, the guide provides useful training material for educators and
lecturers in courses in land administration and land management. ",,

导 读

本研究以上海苏州河滨水绿地植物群落为例，创新性地构建了基于物理与心理降噪效能的综合评估体系。通过实地测量和问卷调查，研究发现，植物群落的物理降噪效能与植物物种丰富度、垂直郁闭度密切相关，密植且枝干较大的乔木和高大灌木能显著增强物理降噪效能。当垂直郁闭度小于35%时，相同郁闭度下，滨水植物群落（植被占比70%、水面占比30%）的物理降噪效能优于陆域植物群落（不包含水面要素）。在心理降噪效能方面，增加灌木的冠幅、高度和间距有助于提升视觉感知；增加垂直郁闭度则能提升听觉感知的丰富度，两者均有助于提高听觉烦恼度阈值。综合降噪效能最佳的植物群落类型为密植乔木与灌木及地被的组合，而滨水植物群落的降噪效能受到垂直郁闭度变化的影响，当垂直郁闭度不低于40%时，可通过提升郁闭度来优化心理降噪效能。

01

引言

噪声问题是全球公认的重要环境问题之一。交通噪声是城市环境噪声的重要组成部分，占城市噪声总量的60%以上。城市绿地是居民休闲游憩的重要场所，利用绿地植物进行降噪是一种低成本且减碳的方法。但目前有关植物降噪效能的研究多集中于植物的单一物理或心理降噪效能方面。

本研究以上海苏州河流域中心城段14个具有不同植物群落特征的城市绿地为例，从物理和心理降噪两个维度构建评价体系，为城市绿地空间的植物景观改造提升提供参考和支撑。

02

相关理论发展

植物群落被称为“绿色消音器”，声波在传播过程中经过绿带时会呈现明显的衰减趋势。目前，关于植物群落物理降噪效能的研究大多集中在声学和植物生理学等领域。此外，植物还可通过声掩蔽效应实现心理层面的降噪。当前关于植物群落心理降噪效能的研究尚处于起步阶段。综上，尽管对植物群落的物理和心理降噪效能已有初步研究，但由于植物群落的多样性和复杂性，其在物理与心理层面的综合降噪效能仍需进一步探讨。

03

研究方法

指标选取

在既往研究和规范的基础上，本研究归纳了与降噪效能相关的植物群落特征要素；创新性构建了基于物理和心理层面的测量与评价体系，以评估综合降噪效能。

植物群落特征要素

本研究根据植被和水面占比的差异，将植物群落分为陆域植物群落（不包含水面）和滨水植物群落（植被占比70%、水面占比30%）。选择以下要素作为植物群落特征要素：



植物群落综合降噪效能评价体系

（1）物理降噪效能评价指标

研究选取等效连续A计权声压级（LAeq）来描述场地的声环境特征，选择测量样地噪声源声压级和噪声通过植物群落后的声压级差值，即噪声相对衰减量作为植物群落物理降噪效能的评价指标。

（2）心理降噪效能评价指标

声掩蔽理论认为，个体或群体在某一场景下感知、经历和／或理解的声学环境，不仅受到声环境本身的影响，还会受到视觉环境及两者交互作用的影响。因此，本研究基于听觉感知和视觉感知两个维度构建心理降噪效能评价指标。语义差异法是听觉感知研究中常用的描述和评价方法。本研究最终确定了安静、和谐、活跃、丰富、愉悦、声源感知类型和噪声烦恼共7项听觉感知评价指标。基于瞭望－庇护、压力舒缓等景观视觉感知理论，去除与听觉感知因素直接关联的指标和语义重复指标，最终确定色彩感、空间感、层次感、氛围感和吸引力共5项视觉感知评价指标。

565,https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs/introduction,"Structured model outputs
Ensure text responses from the model adhere to a JSON schema you define.
JSON is one of the most widely used formats in the world for applications to exchange data.

Structured Outputs is a feature that ensures the model will always generate responses that adhere to your supplied JSON Schema, so you don't need to worry about the model omitting a required key, or hallucinating an invalid enum value.

Some benefits of Structured Outputs include:

Reliable type-safety: No need to validate or retry incorrectly formatted responses
Explicit refusals: Safety-based model refusals are now programmatically detectable
Simpler prompting: No need for strongly worded prompts to achieve consistent formatting
In addition to supporting JSON Schema in the REST API, the OpenAI SDKs for Python and JavaScript also make it easy to define object schemas using Pydantic and Zod respectively. Below, you can see how to extract information from unstructured text that conforms to a schema defined in code.

Getting a structured response
from openai import OpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel

client = OpenAI()

class CalendarEvent(BaseModel):
    name: str
    date: str
    participants: list[str]

response = client.responses.parse(
    model=""gpt-4o-2024-08-06"",
    input=[
        {""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""Extract the event information.""},
        {
            ""role"": ""user"",
            ""content"": ""Alice and Bob are going to a science fair on Friday."",
        },
    ],
    text_format=CalendarEvent,
)

event = response.output_parsed
Supported models
Structured Outputs is available in our latest large language models, starting with GPT-4o. Older models like gpt-4-turbo and earlier may use JSON mode instead.

When to use Structured Outputs via function calling vs via text.format

Structured Outputs is available in two forms in the OpenAI API:

When using function calling
When using a json_schema response format
Function calling is useful when you are building an application that bridges the models and functionality of your application.

For example, you can give the model access to functions that query a database in order to build an AI assistant that can help users with their orders, or functions that can interact with the UI.

Conversely, Structured Outputs via response_format are more suitable when you want to indicate a structured schema for use when the model responds to the user, rather than when the model calls a tool.

For example, if you are building a math tutoring application, you might want the assistant to respond to your user using a specific JSON Schema so that you can generate a UI that displays different parts of the model's output in distinct ways.

Put simply:

If you are connecting the model to tools, functions, data, etc. in your system, then you should use function calling - If you want to structure the model's output when it responds to the user, then you should use a structured text.format
The remainder of this guide will focus on non-function calling use cases in the Responses API. To learn more about how to use Structured Outputs with function calling, check out the

Function Calling

guide.

Structured Outputs vs JSON mode
Structured Outputs is the evolution of JSON mode. While both ensure valid JSON is produced, only Structured Outputs ensure schema adherence. Both Structured Outputs and JSON mode are supported in the Responses API, Chat Completions API, Assistants API, Fine-tuning API and Batch API.

We recommend always using Structured Outputs instead of JSON mode when possible.

However, Structured Outputs with response_format: {type: ""json_schema"", ...} is only supported with the gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18, and gpt-4o-2024-08-06 model snapshots and later.

Structured Outputs	JSON Mode
Outputs valid JSON	Yes	Yes
Adheres to schema	Yes (see supported schemas)	No
Compatible models	gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o-2024-08-06, and later	gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4-* and gpt-4o-* models
Enabling	text: { format: { type: ""json_schema"", ""strict"": true, ""schema"": ... } }	text: { format: { type: ""json_object"" } }
Examples

Structured data extraction

Chain of thought
You can ask the model to output an answer in a structured, step-by-step way, to guide the user through the solution.

Structured Outputs for chain-of-thought math tutoring
from openai import OpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel

client = OpenAI()

class Step(BaseModel):
    explanation: str
    output: str

class MathReasoning(BaseModel):
    steps: list[Step]
    final_answer: str

response = client.responses.parse(
    model=""gpt-4o-2024-08-06"",
    input=[
        {
            ""role"": ""system"",
            ""content"": ""You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step."",
        },
        {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23""},

netimage5 Reasons We Meet Weekly
(Ivan Misner, Ph.D.)
Tue, 19 November 2024
One of the questions I am often asked is: “Are weekly chapter meetings really necessary?” Meeting every week is a serious commitment, and I get it—some people aren’t thrilled about showing up week in and week out for their business networking meeting. In 1986, I decided to experiment with this and launched seven BNI chapters […]

Vertical Farming: A Practical Approach to Modernizing Farms in Africa


ANALYSIS November 13, 2024
Vertical Farming: A Practical Approach to Modernizing Farms in Africa
General
Vertical farming may be a practical path toward transforming traditional African food production. The technologies can boost climate resilience and crop yields to feed the growing population.

Traditional farming in Africa has not been able to provide food security for the entire continent. In part, that is because farms are crippled by climate change and cannot keep up with overpopulation. The continent’s population approaches 1.5 billion, accounting for 18% of the global total. And feeding those people has become harder in a changing climate. Since 1961, climate change has reduced agricultural productivity in Africa by 34%, according to a study by Ariel Ortiz-Bobea at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York (USA) and colleagues.

Vertical farming presents a promising solution. Farms built upwards rather than in the soil can transform the continent’s traditional agriculture using known, practical and locally available technologies.

The Vertical Farming Advantage
Vertical farms stack crops in layers, usually without soil and usually in in a controlled environment indoors or in a greenhouse. These farms maximize space, reduce water consumption and minimize pesticide use. In optimal conditions, a vertical farm can yield 50 to 100 times more per square foot than traditional farms.

By stacking crops vertically, farmers can grow more food on a small land footprint. Their size, shape and readily available parts make them adaptable and scalable, ideal for urban spaces, rooftops, and warehouses. Crops such as leafy greens, herbs, fruiting vegetables, and root vegetables thrive in vertical farms, where space efficiency is maximized. This allows for high-yield farming in urban areas in Africa with high population density, and high land prices like Cairo, Egypt, and Lagos, Nigeria.

Building farms in urban centers has added advantages in cutting the need for long-distance transportation. The result is lower carbon emissions and fresher produce for consumers.

These farms excel in water efficiency. Crops grow without soil in hydroponic, aeroponic, or aquaponic systems that use up to 90% less water than traditional farms. Removing soil also reduces the need for pesticides and herbicides, resulting in a gentler environmental impact and healthier food. Indoor systems may require grow lights, which can be powered by solar panels or other renewable energies for added sustainability.

One more advantage: yields are no longer at the mercy of the weather. The controlled indoor environments of vertical farms enable continuous, year-round production, unaffected by seasonal changes or adverse weather.

The Parts
Vertical farms rely on a combination of mechanical and electrical systems to function efficiently. Mechanical and electrical systems synergize to create optimal conditions for plant growth.

Mechanical systems, such as trays and racks, support the physical structure of plants, while irrigation systems ensure precise water and nutrient delivery. Climate control is maintained through HVAC systems, which, along with CO2 enrichment, tailor the environment to the crop’s needs. Water recycling systems conserve resources, and harvesting systems range from simple manual tools to sophisticated robotics. Packaging and processing equipment streamline the post-harvest workflow, and pest control is managed through a combination of physical barriers and integrated pest management (IPM) strategies.

On the electrical side, lighting systems with LED grow lights and reflective surfaces provide energy-efficient illumination, crucial for photosynthesis. Climate control is further refined with fans, heaters, and chillers. Sensors and monitoring systems continuously track environmental conditions, nutrient levels, and water quality, feeding data back to automation and control systems that adjust parameters as needed. Energy systems, often incorporating renewable sources like solar panels and wind turbines, power the entire operation. Electrically controlled pumps and valves manage irrigation with precision, and harvesting systems benefit from motorized assistance. Pest control also leverages electronic systems to monitor and manage potential infestations.

These components work together to create an optimized environment for plant growth, ensuring sustainability and efficiency.

Local materials, inclusive design

Many locally sourced materials can be used to build low-cost vertical farms in Africa. Bamboo can replace metal for greenhouse frames, wood can be used for growing shelves, and recycled plastic can be repurposed for growing troughs, water tanks, and irrigation pipes. Additionally, clay and stone can be used for foundations and insulation, while natural fibers like jute or hemp can serve as plant containers or shade covers. Renewable energy sources, such as solar panels and biomass systems, can power lighting and climate control.

Engaging local labor and leveraging regional expertise ensures vertical farms are well-suited to the environment while strengthening the local economy. Harvesting tools and post-harvest processing equipment can be made by local artisans, and indigenous plants can be used for organic pest control. Traditional African farming practices, such as crop rotation and organic composting, have long promoted sustainability, and combining these methods with vertical farming can enhance food production, especially in urban areas or regions affected by climate change.

Read More: How to Build a Vertical Aquaponic System
The key to successful integration lies in inclusive design, where local farmers are treated as stakeholders, and their knowledge of ecosystems and crops informs vertical farming practices. This approach recognizes that local expertise is invaluable and should guide the development of agricultural technologies. By empowering local farmers and involving them in decision-making processes, Africa can create a modern agricultural system that blends new technology with traditional practices. Such a system not only enhances productivity but also fosters a sense of ownership and responsibility among farmers. Ultimately, this collaboration ensures sustainable and resilient food production for the future, adapting to local needs and environmental conditions.

Building vertical farms in Africa offers a strategic and innovative solution to address the continent’s agricultural challenges, such as urbanization, limited arable land, water scarcity, and the need for food security in regions with harsh climates. A transformation of this scale takes work. But vertical farms offer a practical path forward using local materials and local labor. By adopting vertical farming, African countries stand to boost crop yields, create jobs, and reduce environmental impact.

Magnificent Seven Stocks: Nvidia Rallies To Record Highs; Tesla Slides
FacebookXLinkedInShare Licensing
SCOTT LEHTONENUpdated 01:47 PM ET 07/09/2025
Dubbed the Magnificent Seven stocks, Apple, Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet, Amazon.com, Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Tesla lived up to their name in 2024 with solid gains. Through the first six months of 2025, however, performance for these mega-cap stocks has been sharply mixed thus far.

Due to their outsized market capitalizations, Magnificent Seven stocks hold a disproportionate influence on the market-cap weighted Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 indexes.

Here’s What The IPO Wave Predicts For 2025
For an in-depth look at this issue, check out IBD's page on the Magnificent Seven weightings, market capitalizations and the companies' latest news stories.

On Wednesday, the Roundhill Magnificent Seven (MAGS) exchange traded fund rose 1%.

Nvidia Stock Extends Gains
Nvidia rallied 2% Wednesday, hitting another record high. Shares are moving further above a 153.13 buy point in a base that stretched back to January.


On May 28, Nvidia beat Wall Street's lowered targets for its fiscal first quarter but its sales guidance for the current period was below views.

The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company earned an adjusted 81 cents a share on sales of $44.06 billion in the quarter ended April 27. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected Nvidia to earn an adjusted 73 cents a share on sales of $43.34 billion in fiscal Q1. In the year-earlier period, Nvidia earned an adjusted 61 cents a share on sales of $26.04 billion.

Chief Executive Jensen Huang said he is confident that President Trump will make the right decisions when it comes to supporting the U.S. AI industry.

""The president has a plan. He has a vision and I trust him,"" Huang said. President Trump wants to win the AI race, he said.

Huang listed four positive surprises this year for the AI market. They include demand growth from inference reasoning, agentic AI, industrial AI and the cancelation of the Biden-era AI Diffusion Rule.

Magnificent Seven Stocks: Amazon Above Buy Point
Amazon.com (AMZN) stock is above a 214.84 buy point in a cup with handle and in the 5% buy zone. And shares climbed 1.5% Wednesday.

On May 1, Amazon gave a mixed outlook for the current quarter – further fueling investor fears about the impact of tariffs on the company's e-commerce empire. Amazon's profit-driving cloud business recorded March quarter revenue slightly below Wall Street expectations.

Amazon's overall top- and bottom-line results for the first quarter beat Wall Street estimates. The Seattle-based company said that it earned an adjusted $1.59 per share on sales of $155.7 billion for the March-ended quarter. Analysts polled by FactSet projected Amazon would post adjusted earnings of $1.37 per share on sales of $155.2 billion. Sales increased 9% while earnings increased 62% year over year.

Tesla Stock Slides
Tesla (TSLA) skidded nearly 1% Wednesday, falling back near this week's lows. The EV giant set an all-time high on Dec. 18, topping out at 488.53, but is around 40% off that high. Shares are also squarely below their 50- and 200-day moving average lines following sharp losses in recent sessions.

On April 22, Tesla reported that Q1 EPS sank 40% to 27 cents per share while revenue fell 9% to $19.335 billion. Analysts expected earnings of 41 cents a share and sales totaling $21.27 billion, according to FactSet. However, the sharps consensus pegged quarterly revenue at $19.76 billion.

The EV giant said that it would ""revisit"" its 2025 guidance in its second-quarter update. ""It is difficult to measure the impacts of shifting global trade policy on the automotive and energy supply chains, our cost structure and demand for durable goods and related services,"" Tesla said in the earnings release.

Dow Jones Stocks In Magnificent 7: Apple, Microsoft
Besides Nvidia stock, there are two other Dow Jones names among the Magnificent Seven: Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT).

Apple stock dropped 0.8% Wednesday, holding above the 50-day line.

On May 1, Apple reported better-than-expected March-quarter results provided only a temporary reprieve from the challenges facing the consumer electronics giant. Investors also weighed the impact of tariffs on hardware sales and legal cases threatening its services business.

The Cupertino, Calif.-based company said it earned $1.65 a share, up 8% year over year, on sales of $95.4 billion, up 5%, in its fiscal second quarter ended March 29. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected earnings of $1.62 a share on sales of $94.54 billion.

Meanwhile, Microsoft crushed Wall Street's targets for its fiscal third quarter and guided above views for the current period.

The Redmond, Wash.-based software giant earned $3.46 a share on sales of $70.07 billion in the quarter ended March 31. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected earnings of $3.22 a share on sales of $68.44 billion. On a year-over-year basis, Microsoft earnings rose 18% while sales increased 13%.

Shares climbed 0.8% in Wednesday trading. Microsoft is squarely above a 448.38 buy point and at new highs.

Meta Stock Above Buy Point
Shares of Meta Platforms (META) gained 2% Wednesday, moving further out of buy range past a cup-with-handle's 662.67 buy point.


On April 30, the social media giant's first-quarter results and sales outlook eased fears about tariffs squeezing its advertising business. CEO Mark Zuckerberg also indicated its full-speed ahead for the Facebook parent company's significant AI investments.

Meta said that it earned $6.43 per share on sales of $42.3 billion for the March-ended quarter. Analysts polled by FactSet projected the Menlo Park, Calif.-based company would post adjusted earnings of $5.23 per share on sales of $41.3 billion.

Meta stock shows a great 96 IBD Composite Rating, per the IBD Stock Checkup.

Alphabet Rebounds
Alphabet (GOOGL) is approaching a 181.23 buy point in a cup with handle following a recent rebound. Shares climbed 1.9% Wednesday.

On April 24, Alphabet delivered first quarter earnings and revenue that topped consensus estimates as internet search advertising growth beat expectations.

Google earnings for the quarter ending March 31 surged 48% to $2.81 per share. The tech giant reports Google earnings under generally accepted accounting principles, also known as GAAP. Adjusted operating margin came in at 40%, topping estimates of 38%.

In Q1, Google's gross revenue rose 12% to $90.2 billion amid headwinds from currency exchange rates and a weaker U.S. dollar.

Analysts polled by FactSet had projected EPS of $2.01 on revenue of $89.2 billion.

cybercrime, hacking and technology concept - hands of hacker in dark room writing code or using computer virus program for cyber attackPhoto: 123RF
A cyber security firm says hackers are selling access to IT systems at hundreds of New Zealand schools and tertiary institutes, as well as stolen personal data from thousands of staff and students.

Cyber Sentience said it found the information being traded on websites on the so-called dark web for just a few dollars last year.

In a report published on Monday, it said it also found evidence hackers were using a New Zealand primary school's website as a training ground to practise hacking.

It said cyberattacks on New Zealand education institutions were growing exponentially, and schools in particular needed more protection.

It said the information for sale last year included alleged vulnerabilities in the IT systems of seven of New Zealand's eight universities, access to 556 education sector web services and to 31 institutions' email services.

Hackers were also sharing the logins and passwords of 2359 people in universities, polytechnics and industry training organisations and for countless people in schools.

It said one hacker was selling backdoor access to a primary school's IT systems and others were sharing a database stolen from a secondary school.

Cyber Sentience founder Tom Crisp said stolen personal credentials generally sold for between US$2-$10 (NZ$3.30-$16) and access to a New Zealand school's webserver was listed for US$8 (NZ$13.20).

Crisp said he did not know if any of the hacks had resulted in financial losses or blackmail of individuals or institutions.

He said several posts indicated hackers had discovered and shared a vulnerability in a web application belonging to a New Zealand school several years ago.

""A few years later, we detect Russian, Turkish and Arabic-speaking threat actors in closed communities sharing this vulnerability as a 'training target'. Interactive mentoring encouraged and supported the abuse of this school's system. One of the locations where this activity was occurring is known to be state aligned, with the others focused on e-crime and hacktivism.""

'On the money'
Ministry of Education chief digital officer Stuart Wakefield told RNZ he could not confirm the report's details but its broad findings about the types of problems affecting schools were ""definitely on the money"".

Wakefield said schools' computer networks were well-protected, but students and staff often used their computers and phones at home and for purposes other than school-work.

""What this report shows is students are using things like their school-issued email address as their username on a whole range of websites and systems and apps and services, and some small number of those has been compromised,"" he said.

Wakefield said the ministry contacted schools when it found that student or staff credentials had been stolen, but it was hard to stay ahead of the hackers.

""We're always playing a little bit of catch-up here. We're talking about an organised criminal enterprise here that is trying to exploit not just schools and kura but all New Zealand organisations and all New Zealanders,"" he said.

""To that extent that we can we are putting all our effort into things that mitigate that risk, so precautions such as use of two-factor authentication and making sure people have strong passwords and making sure their devices are kept up to date with the latest patches.""

Universities use existing expertise
Wakefield said Cyber Sentience had refused to provide detailed information without payment.

Crisp said the company had arrangements with other organisations which meant it could not share further information with the Ministry of Education without a formal agreement.

Meanwhile, universities dismissed Cyber Sentience's approach to them earlier this year as an attempt to generate business.

Universities New Zealand told RNZ its members preferred to use their existing in-house or third-party expertise to manage cyber security.

It could not confirm whether universities investigated alleged vulnerabilities raised by Cyber Sentience and universities did not answer RNZ's questions about whether those vulnerabilities had been investigated and found to exist.

AUT and the University of Waikato said Cyber Sentience's information did not raise any concerns.

RNZ reported last year that a major school IT project was on hold because school's IT systems were too vulnerable to hacking.","RNZ Stations

Pas d’allocations chômage pour l’agent demandant sa mise à la retraite anticipée
Public - Public
Travail et social - Travail et social
12/04/2023
Par un arrêt rendu le 30 mars 2023, le Conseil d’État annonce qu’un agent public sollicitant lui-même sa mise à la retraite anticipée pour invalidité ne peut pas bénéficier de l’allocation d’aide au retour à l’emploi, ne pouvant être regardé comme un travailleur involontairement privé d’emploi.
Dans son arrêt du 30 mars 2023 (CE, 30 mars 2023, n° 460907, Lebon T.), le Conseil d’État vient préciser la condition de travailleur « involontairement privé d’emploi », ouvrant droit au bénéfice des allocations d’aide au retour à l’emploi (ARE). Si cette qualification s’applique à l’agent mis à la retraite d’office, un agent ayant demandé sa mise à la retraite anticipée ne peut pas être regardé comme involontairement privé d’emploi.
 
Dans cette affaire, une agente territoriale avait été placée en congé de longue durée. Quatre ans plus tard, l’agente a sollicité la prolongation de ce congé puis son admission à la retraite pour invalidité. La commission départementale de réforme de la fonction publique territoriale a conclu à l’inaptitude définitive et absolue de l’agente. La caisse nationale des retraites des agents des collectivités a, de son côté, rendu un avis concluant à la mise à la retraite anticipée au motif d’un taux global d’invalidité de 50 %. L’agente a alors été radiée des cadres pour invalidité et admise à la retraite anticipée.
 
L’agente s’est ensuite inscrite sur la liste des demandeurs d’emploi et a demandé le bénéfice de l’ARE, puis a saisi le tribunal administratif d’une demande d’annulation de la décision implicite de rejet du président du conseil du département, son ancien employeur.

Travailleur involontairement privé d’emploi
 
L’allocation d’aide au retour à l’emploi, ou allocation chômage, est encadrée par l’article L. 5421-1 du Code du travail, en application duquel elle peut versée aux travailleurs aptes au travail et recherchant un emploi, soit dont la privation d’emploi est involontaire, soit dont le contrat de travail a été rompu conventionnellement ou d’un commun accord.
 
Ces dispositions concernent les agents publics, en application de l’article L. 5424-1 du même code. L’article L. 5424-1 rappelle également pour les fonctionnaires et agents non titulaires la condition de privation involontaire d’emploi.
 
Par ailleurs, l’article L. 29 du code des pensions civiles et militaires de retraite prévoit : « Le fonctionnaire civil qui se trouve dans l'incapacité permanente de continuer ses fonctions en raison d'une invalidité ne résultant pas du service et qui n'a pu être reclassé dans un autre corps (...) peut être radié des cadres par anticipation soit sur sa demande, soit d'office (...) ».
 
L’article 30 du décret n° 2003-1306 du 26 décembre 2003 relatif au régime de retraite des fonctionnaires affiliés à la caisse nationale de retraites des agents des collectivités locales prévoit : « Le fonctionnaire qui se trouve dans l'impossibilité définitive et absolue de continuer ses fonctions par suite de maladie, blessure ou infirmité grave dûment établie peut être admis à la retraite soit d'office, soit sur demande ».
 
Mise à la retraite d’office
 
Le Conseil annonce dans son arrêt du 30 mars 2023 qu’il résulte de ces dispositions que seule la mise à la retraite d’office constitue un cas de perte involontaire d’emploi pouvant ouvrir droit à une allocation d’aide au retour à l’emploi.

A contrario, un agent qui a sollicité lui-même son admission à la retraite anticipée pour invalidité ne peut être regardé comme ayant été involontairement privé d'emploi, et par conséquent, ne peut bénéficier de l’allocation.
 
En l’espèce, l’agente avait sollicité elle-même sa mise à la retraite anticipée, à la suite de son congé de longue durée. Elle ne pouvait donc pas être considérée comme involontairement privée d’emploi, ni bénéficier de l’allocation.","Cabinet d'Avocats R & R

Restate 1.2: a distributed durable execution engine, built from first principles
February 18, 2025
Ahmed Farghal, Till Rohrmann, Nik Nasr, Giselle van Dongen, Jack Kleeman, Francesco Guardiani, Igal Shilman, Muhamad Awad, Pavel Tcholakov, Stephan Ewen

Restate lets you write mission-critical applications, like payment workflows, user management, and AI agents, without worrying about resiliency. With Restate 1.2, you can now run these applications at scale with highly-available Restate clusters that tolerate node failures while keeping your applications responsive, resilient, and consistent. Restate is designed to run well wherever you want it to: on cloud, on-prem, across AZs, and even across regions. Restate now also includes a graphical UI to give you an intuitive way to introspect and debug your applications.

Restate is open, free, and available at GitHub or at the Restate website.

The simplest way to write resilient applications
It’s still too hard to write applications that are fully resilient. Wouldn't it be great if you could stop worrying about all possible failure scenarios and race conditions in your applications such as charging customers twice, users withdrawing more cash than they have, and selling a single ticket multiple times? Application code is flooded with retry, recovery, and coordination logic across message queues, key-value stores, workflows, and cron jobs. This turns our applications into distributed systems that are hard to reason about and hard to debug.

Restate solves this by capturing all application activity—RPC calls, timers, promises, API calls—into a single, reliable log. In case of failures, Restate retries the execution and recovers the process and all previous state. Restate automatically mitigates against a large class of infrastructure failures, race conditions, timeouts, and other inconsistencies.

This concept is often called Durable Execution. Restate is a Durable Execution engine with some unique characteristics:

Simple, flexible programming model: an intuitive microservice-style API to express your business logic purely in code. No need to mash your business logic into YAML workflow definitions or intertwine it with event-based programming models, just to get the resiliency you want.
Easy to deploy and operate: Restate is a single binary - no need to deploy databases, queues or extra dependencies to make it work. Together with the Restate CLI for debugging and inspection, this makes developing with Restate a nice experience.
Smart integration with serverless platforms by suspending waiting functions.
Detailed observability into how your requests are executed across your services without complex tools and setups
Our flavour of durable execution is the perfect match for stateful asynchronous programs, like AI Agents. Anthropic recently discussed ways to implement AI Agents, like chaining LLM API calls, dynamic/flexible routing, parallelization, and orchestration. Restate excels at all of these by making them easy to implement and fully resilient by default.

Restate can help power any application requiring resiliency and consistency, such as payments, inventory management, managing user signups and subscriptions, order processing, but also technical patterns like sagas, distributed transactions, task fan-out/fan-in, and async task scheduling.","Build innately resilient distributed apps — without the complexity tax.

Dimitri Stanley could have not picked a better way for his high school athletic career to end, standing atop the podium at Jefferson County Stadium on Saturday with his Cherry Creek teammates.

After helping the Bruins to the state championship in the Class 5A 400-meter relay, Stanley walked off the podium and, in a few short weeks, will begin his collegiate career with the Colorado football team.

“I’m ready for the challenge, honestly, to get up there and compete and try to earn my spot, earn my stripes and get to work,” he said. “Hopefully we can get some national championships.”","News

Brick House Ciento Por Ciento Slated for TAA 2019

Last September, J.C. Newman Cigar Co. previewed a new line of Brick House in Germany and indicated it was likely that it could become a TAA release in the future.

The Brick House Ciento Por Ciento, which translates to 100 percent, is a Nicaraguan puro with a Jalapa wrapper. It will now be offered stateside as an exclusive offering for retail members of the Tobacconists’ Association of America (TAA). The Ciento Por Ciento TAA 2019 is a 6 1/4 x 54 vitola, different than the vitola that was offered in Germany.

Production is limited to 500 boxes of 25 cigars, priced at $7.40 per cigar. J.C. Newman expects the cigars to begin shipping in May.



The TAA is a fairly small group of some of the country’s top tobacconists, about 80 retailers as well as 40 or so manufacturers. The association gathers annually to discuss issues facing the industry and retailers, as well as to have its annual trade show, a unique event that works on a group buying format in order to secure exclusive deals for these generally high-volume merchants.

It is set to take place March 17-21 at Casa de Campo in La Romana, Dominican Republic.

CLE, Crowned Heads and Tatuaje have also announced TAA 2019 releases.

Meet complexity with simplicity
Even for the most experienced sites, starting up a new study is notoriously inefficient and burdensome. With protocols and regulations growing in complexity, it’s harder to recruit and retain patients, and setting up all the technology their expected to use takes a valiant effort. Many sites become so overwhelmed by the administrative burden that they withdraw after a single trial, further reducing the pool of investigators available for study opportunities from sponsors.

Every expression written in the Java programming language either produces no result (§15.1) or has a type that can be deduced at compile time (§15.3). When an expression appears in most contexts, it must be compatible with a type expected in that context; this type is called the target type. For convenience, compatibility of an expression with its surrounding context is facilitated in two ways:

First, for some expressions, termed poly expressions (§15.2), the deduced type can be influenced by the target type. The same expression can have different types in different contexts.

Second, after the type of the expression has been deduced, an implicit conversion from the type of the expression to the target type can sometimes be performed.

If neither strategy is able to produce the appropriate type, a compile-time error occurs.

The rules determining whether an expression is a poly expression, and if so, its type and compatibility in a particular context, vary depending on the kind of context and the form of the expression. In addition to influencing the type of the expression, the target type may in some cases influence the run time behavior of the expression in order to produce a value of the appropriate type.

Similarly, the rules determining whether a target type allows an implicit conversion vary depending on the kind of context, the type of the expression, and, in one special case, the value of a constant expression (§15.29). A conversion from type S to type T allows an expression of type S to be treated at compile time as if it had type T instead. In some cases this will require a corresponding action at run time to check the validity of the conversion or to translate the run-time value of the expression into a form appropriate for the new type T.

Example 5.0-1. Conversions at Compile Time and Run Time

A conversion from type Object to type Thread requires a run-time check to make sure that the run-time value is actually an instance of class Thread or one of its subclasses; if it is not, an exception is thrown.

A conversion from type Thread to type Object requires no run-time action; Thread is a subclass of Object, so any reference produced by an expression of type Thread is a valid reference value of type Object.

A conversion from type int to type long requires run-time sign-extension of a 32-bit integer value to the 64-bit long representation. No information is lost.

A conversion from type double to type long requires a non-trivial translation from a 64-bit floating-point value to the 64-bit integer representation. Depending on the actual run-time value, information may be lost.


The conversions possible in the Java programming language are grouped into several broad categories:

Identity conversions

Widening primitive conversions

Narrowing primitive conversions

Widening reference conversions

Narrowing reference conversions

Boxing conversions

Unboxing conversions

Unchecked conversions

Capture conversions

String conversions

There are six kinds of conversion contexts in which poly expressions may be influenced by context or implicit conversions may occur. Each kind of context has different rules for poly expression typing and allows conversions in some of the categories above but not others. The contexts are:

Assignment contexts (§5.2, §15.26), in which an expression's value is bound to a named variable. Primitive and reference types are subject to widening, values may be boxed or unboxed, and some primitive constant expressions may be subject to narrowing. An unchecked conversion may also occur.

Strict invocation contexts (§5.3, §15.9, §15.12), in which an argument is bound to a formal parameter of a constructor or method. Widening primitive, widening reference, and unchecked conversions may occur.

Loose invocation contexts (§5.3, §15.9, §15.12), in which, like strict invocation contexts, an argument is bound to a formal parameter. Method or constructor invocations may provide this context if no applicable declaration can be found using only strict invocation contexts. In addition to widening and unchecked conversions, this context allows boxing and unboxing conversions to occur.

String contexts (§5.4, §15.18.1), in which a value of any type is converted to an object of type String.

Casting contexts (§5.5), in which an expression's value is converted to a type explicitly specified by a cast operator (§15.16). Casting contexts are more inclusive than assignment or loose invocation contexts, allowing any specific conversion other than a string conversion, but certain casts to a reference type are checked for correctness at run time.

Numeric contexts (§5.6), in which the operands of a numeric operator or some other expressions that operate on numbers may be widened to a common type.

The term ""conversion"" is also used to describe, without being specific, any conversions allowed in a particular context. For example, we say that an expression that is the initializer of a local variable is subject to ""assignment conversion"", meaning that a specific conversion will be implicitly chosen for that expression according to the rules for the assignment context. As another example, we say that an expression undergoes ""casting conversion"" to mean that the expression's type will be converted as permitted in a casting context.

Example 5.0-2. Conversions In Various Contexts

class Test {			
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Casting conversion (5.5) of a float literal to
        // type int. Without the cast operator, this would
        // be a compile-time error, because this is a
        // narrowing conversion (5.1.3):
        int i = (int)12.5f;

        // String conversion (5.4) of i's int value:
        System.out.println(""(int)12.5f=="" + i);

        // Assignment conversion (5.2) of i's value to type
        // float. This is a widening conversion (5.1.2):
        float f = i;

        // String conversion of f's float value:
        System.out.println(""after float widening: "" + f);

        // Numeric promotion (5.6) of i's value to type
        // float. This is a binary numeric promotion.
        // After promotion, the operation is float*float:
        System.out.print(f);
        f = f * i;

        // Two string conversions of i and f:
        System.out.println(""*"" + i + ""=="" + f);

        // Invocation conversion (5.3) of f's value
        // to type double, needed because the method Math.sin
        // accepts only a double argument:
        double d = Math.sin(f);

        // Two string conversions of f and d:
        System.out.println(""Math.sin("" + f + "")=="" + d);
    }
}

This program produces the output:

(int)12.5f==12
after float widening: 12.0
12.0*12==144.0
Math.sin(144.0)==-0.49102159389846934","

Jakie są zabawy rozwijające umiejętności społeczne dzieci w przedszkolu?
Zabawy rozwijające umiejętności społeczne dzieci w przedszkoluZabawy rozwijające umiejętności społeczne dzieci mają szczególnie ważne zadanie. Nie tylko wspierają rozwój emocjonalny, ale także kształtują wiele zdolności interpersonalnych niezbędnych w codziennym życiu. Czy warto ćwiczyć kompetencje społeczne u dziecka? Jakie zabawy mogą pomóc w ich rozwoju? Zobacz, jaki jest wpływ zabawy na rozwój aktywności społecznej dziecka.

Dlaczego warto rozwijać umiejętności społeczne u dziecka?
Kształtowanie umiejętności społecznych to ważny element rozwoju, który ma znaczenie nie tylko z punktu widzenia tego, jak dziecko poradzi sobie w grupie rówieśniczej w przedszkolu, czy szkole. Kompetencje te odgrywają ważną rolę przez całe życie, wpływając między innymi na zdolność nawiązywania relacji z innymi, skuteczną komunikację, wyrażanie swoich potrzeb, czy kształtowanie postaw empatii oraz tolerancji. Wszelkie zabawy rozwijające umiejętności społeczne dzieci wspierają również zdolność rozumienia swojej roli w społeczeństwie i dostosowywania się do norm, jakie w nim panują.

Jak nauczyć dziecko zachowań społecznych?
Zachowania społeczne można kształtować u dzieci na kilka sposobów:

Obserwowanie i naśladowanie dorosłych – dzieci są doskonałymi obserwatorami i szybko zaczynają naśladować zachowanie dorosłych, dlatego też warto zachowywać się w taki sposób, jakiego oczekuje się od swojej pociechy, dając dobry przykład.
Kształtowanie postaw przez wychowanie – rozumienie zachowań społecznych przez najmłodszych wymaga wielu rozmów i tłumaczenia, dlaczego coś jest dobre, a coś złe oraz jakie konsekwencje mogą mieć określone działania.
Zabawy rozwijające umiejętności społeczne – zabawa jest pierwszym i podstawowym środowiskiem dla dziecięcego rozwoju, dlatego też stanowi jedno z najważniejszych narzędzi do kształtowania zachowań społecznych. Taki rodzaj aktywności może uczyć między innymi współpracy i dzielenia się, rozwiązywania konfliktów, stawiania się w sytuacjach innych osób oraz dostosowywania się do zasad panujących w danej grupie.
Praktykowanie – równie ważnym sposobem rozwijania umiejętności społecznych jest możliwość ćwiczenia ich w realnych sytuacjach przez same dzieci. Warto więc stworzyć maluchowi przestrzeń do samodzielnego rozwiązywania konfliktów rówieśniczych, wchodzenia w interakcje społeczne, czy radzenia sobie z emocjami.
Jak ćwiczyć umiejętności społeczne?
Jedną z najefektywniejszych metod rozwijania kompetencji interpersonalnych i emocjonalnych u dzieci są zabawy społeczne. Przykłady tego rodzaju aktywności można mnożyć:

Gry i zabawy zespołowe – aktywności zespołowe, poprzez konieczność współpracy i konkurowania, uczą najmłodszych efektywnej komunikacji, dzielenia się oraz rozwiązywania problemów w sposób, który przysłuży się większej grupie osób. Takie zabawy rozwijające umiejętności społeczne dzieci, szczególnie w przedszkolu, to przede wszystkim sporty drużynowe, takie jak gra w piłkę, przeciąganie liny, czy gry planszowe.
Praca w zespołach nad wspólnym projektem – taki rodzaj aktywności zachęca dzieci do współpracy, pozwala na podejmowanie decyzji z myślą o ogóle oraz uczy kompromisów.
Zabawy odtwórcze – odgrywanie ról umożliwia najmłodszym przede wszystkim utożsamianie się z emocjami innych, pokazuje, jak radzić sobie w określonych sytuacjach, i uczy sprawczości oraz podejmowania decyzji.
Tworzenie historii i opowiadanie – wspólne tworzenie opowieści zachęca dzieci do wyrażania swoich emocji, rozwija kompetencje językowe, a także wspiera postawy empatii.
Zabawa w teatr, odgrywanie ról – to inny rodzaj zabaw rozwijających umiejętności społeczne dzieci, gdzie uczą się one wczuwania w emocje innych i podejmowania decyzji. Takie aktywności pomagają także kształtować określone zachowania w stosunku do innych dzieci.
Zabawy konstrukcyjne – pomagają zrozumieć dziecku rolę współpracy podczas realizacji jednego projektu, a także uczą cierpliwości i radzenia sobie z niepowodzeniami.Dzieci bawiące się w przedszkolu a zabawy rozwijające umiejętności społeczne
Co to jest trening umiejętności społecznych dla dzieci?
Trening umiejętności społecznych to forma zajęć grupowych moderowanych przez trenera. W ich ramach odbywają się rozmaite aktywności mające na celu kształtowanie określonych zachowań i postaw u osób, które biorą w nich udział. Pozwalają one dzieciom między innymi lepiej odnajdywać się w codziennych sytuacjach, dają im narzędzia do wyrażania swoich emocji oraz budują poczucie wartości i pewność siebie. To, jak wyglądają takie treningi, zależy znów przede wszystkim od programu i wieku grupy docelowej. Często jednak ich częścią są różnorakie gry i zabawy rozwijające umiejętności społeczne.

Do kogo są skierowane treningi umiejętności społecznych? W tego rodzaju zajęciach mogą brać udział praktycznie wszyscy zainteresowani. Należy jednak pamiętać, że poszczególne programy są opracowywane raczej nie z myślą o ogóle, ale o potrzebach określonych grup wiekowych i bez problemu można znaleźć takie warsztaty, w których mogą uczestniczyć już dzieci w wieku przedszkolnym.

Jak rozwijać kompetencje społeczne dzieci w wieku przedszkolnym?
Kilkulatki są bardzo ciekawe świata oraz chętnie uczestniczą w różnych rodzajach aktywności organizowanych tak w domu, jak i w przedszkolu, a niemal każdy z nich może być okazją, aby wspierać kompetencje interpersonalne i społeczne. Co więcej, zabawy rozwijające umiejętności społeczne dzieci w przedszkolu są poniekąd niezbędne, by maluchy zrozumiały, czego się od nich oczekuje, oraz nauczyły się funkcjonowania w dużej grupie rówieśniczej, gdzie spotykają się różne temperamenty, potrzeby i doświadczenia.

Jakie mogą być zabawy rozwijające kompetencje emocjonalno-społeczne w przedszkolu?

Zabawy uczące empatii: zabawy naśladowcze (w dom, księżniczki i rycerzy, opiekę nad zwierzętami itp.), czytanie opowieści i rozmowa na ich temat.
Zabawy uczące komunikacji i współpracy: wszelkie zabawy z podziałem na grupy (praca nad wspólnym projektami, zabawy klockami), aktywności na placu zabaw, tory przeszkód, zabawa swobodna, czyli wybierana samodzielnie przez dzieci.
Zabawy kształtujące postawy społeczne: wspólne spacery i wyjścia poza teren przedszkola, uczestnictwo w warsztatach plastycznych, kulinarnych lub innych, wspólne czytanie.
Zabawy wspomagające samoregulację: zabawy sensoryczne, gra w gry planszowe, odgrywanie scenek, zabawy wymagające dostosowania się do zasad (np. baba-jaga patrzy, kalambury i inne).
Chcesz poznać inne rodzaje zabaw, w jakich dzieci uczestniczą w przedszkolu? Zobacz: Zabawy w przedszkolu – rodzaje zabaw organizowanych dla przedszkolaków.

Warto także pamiętać, że znaczenie mają nie tylko same zabawy rozwijające umiejętności społeczne dzieci w przedszkolu, ale również i sam pobyt w placówce. Sytuacja, w której maluch musi poradzić sobie bez rodzica, stanowi ważną lekcję samodzielności i zaufania. Jednocześnie uczy wchodzenia w różne relacje, z których każda jest oparta na innych zasadach, oraz zaznajamia ze skuteczną komunikacją.

Jeśli szukasz placówki dbającej o kompleksowy rozwój dziecka z poszanowaniem jego emocji i możliwości rozwojowych, odwiedź przedszkole na Woli Bajeczka! O naszych podopiecznych dba empatyczna, doświadczona kadra, która każdego dnia staje na wyżynach kreatywności, zapewniając im atrakcyjne, dopasowane do wieku aktywności. Wśród nich znajdują się także zabawy rozwijające umiejętności społeczne. Dzieci w przedszkolu mają do dyspozycji również świetnie wyposażone sale z bogatą kolekcją zabawek, dzięki czemu oczekiwanie na rodziców im się nie dłuży. Już teraz zapoznaj się z naszą ofertą na bieżący rok szkolny!

Jak ćwiczyć kompetencje społeczne dziecka w domu?
W zabawy rozwijające umiejętności społeczne dzieci można bawić się także w domu. Co więcej, przestrzeń ta stwarza zupełnie nowe możliwości i pozwala na wprowadzenie innych niż przedszkolne rodzajów aktywności. Jak można wspierać kompetencje emocjonalno-społeczne w domu?

Gry planszowe – gra w kameralnym gronie wspiera samoregulację, uczy przegrywania, czekania na swoją kolej oraz przeżywania emocji związanych z niezaspokojeniem oczekiwań.
Wspólne gotowanie – to doskonała lekcja cierpliwości, która jednocześnie pokazuje, że określone działania mają takie, a nie inne skutki.
Zabawy naśladujące codzienne czynności – wspierają postawę empatii oraz uczą właściwych zachowań, dzięki czemu dziecko lepiej rozumie potrzeby i stany emocjonalne innych osób.
Zabawy związane z rozumieniem emocji – dzieci często nie wiedzą, co dokładnie czują, a wszelkie zabawy związane z rozpoznawaniem i nazywaniem emocji mogą pomóc im w zrozumieniu samego siebie.","Blog

Artificial IntelligenceCreating Artificial Mechanical Turks With Pretrained Language Modelsmm
Published December 30, 2021 Updated December 9, 2022
By Martin Anderson

A large part of the development of machine learning systems depends on labeling of data, where hundreds, even thousands of questions (such as Is this a picture of a cat? and Is this text offensive?) must be settled in order to develop authoritative datasets on which AI systems will be trained.

Though we all contribute to this process at some point, the majority of these labeling tasks are performed for money by human workers at frameworks such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, where annotators complete minor classification tasks in a piece-work economy.

Model development would be cheaper if pretrained language models (PLMs) could in themselves undertake some of the more basic Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs) currently being crowdsourced at AMT and similar platforms.

Recent research from Germany and Huawei proposes this, in the paper LMTurk: Few-Shot Learners as Crowdsourcing Workers.

Language Models Performing Few-Shot Learning
The authors suggest that the simpler strata of tasks typically aimed at (human) Turk workers are analogous to few-shot learning, where an automated framework has to decide a mini-task based on a small number of examples given to it.

They therefore propose that AI systems can learn effectively from existing PLMs that were originally trained by crowdworkers – that the core knowledge imparted from people to machines has effectively been accomplished already, and that where such knowledge is relatively immutable or empirical in some way, automated language model frameworks can potentially perform these tasks in themselves.

‘Our basic idea is that, for an NLP task T, we treat few-shot learners as non-expert workers, resembling crowdsourcing workers that annotate resources for human language technology. We are inspired by the fact that we can view a crowdsourcing worker as a type of few-shot learner.’

The implications include the possibility that many of the ground truths that AI systems of the future depend upon will have been derived from humans quite some years earlier, thereafter treated as pre-validated and exploitable information that no longer requires human intervention.

Jobs for Mid-Range, Semi-performant Language Models
Besides the motivation to cut the cost of humans-in-the-loop, the researchers suggest that using ‘mid-range’ PLMs as truly Mechanical Turks provides useful work for these ‘also ran’ systems, which are increasingly being overshadowed by headline-grabbing, hyperscale and costly language models such as GPT-3, which are too expensive and over-specced for such tasks.

‘Our goal in this paper is to devise methods that make more effective use of current few-shot learners. This is crucial because an increasing number of gigantic few-shot learners are trained; how to use them effectively is thus an important question. In particular, we want an alternative to hard-to-deploy huge models.

‘At the same time, we want to take full advantage of the PLMs’ strengths: Their versatility ensures wide applicability across tasks; their vast store of knowledge about language and the world (learned in pretraining) manifests in the data efficiency of few-shot learners, reducing labor and time consumption in data annotation.’

To date, the authors argue, few-shot learners in NLP have been treated as disposable interstitial stages on the road to high-level natural language systems that are far more resource intensive, and that such work has been undertaken abstractly and without consideration for the possible utility of these systems.

Method
The authors’ offer LMTurk (Language Model as mechanical Turk), in a workflow where input from this automated HIT provides labels for a mid-level NLP model.","About Us Meet the Team Our Charter .AI Domain Names Press Tools Contact Us

SpaceX plans to catch Starship upper stage with 'chopsticks' in early 2025, Elon Musk says

SpaceX doesn't plan to rest on its rocket-catching laurels.

The company made spaceflight history on Sunday (Oct. 13) during the fifth test flight of its Starship megarocket: About seven minutes after liftoff, the vehicle's first-stage booster, known as Super Heavy, came back to its launch mount, where it was caught by the ""chopstick"" arms of the launch tower.

And SpaceX aims to do the same with Starship's 165-foot-tall (50 meters) upper-stage spacecraft — known as Starship, or simply Ship — in the coming months as well, according to company founder and CEO Elon Musk. ""Hopefully early next year, we will catch the ship too,"" Musk said Tuesday (Oct. 15) in a post on X (formerly Twitter).

SpaceX is developing the 400-foot-tall (122 meters), fully reusable Starship to get people and cargo to the moon and Mars, and perform a variety of other spaceflight feats as well. Things are going well; the vehicle's most recent two test flights — on June 6 and this past Sunday — were complete successes, according to the company.

So it shouldn't be a big surprise that SpaceX plans to push the envelope, bringing Ship back safely on one or more upcoming test flights. (On recent missions, the upper stage has splashed down in the Indian Ocean.)

Launch-tower catches of Ship likely won't apply to all of the vehicle's missions, however. For example, the upper stage will carry people to the surface of the moon and Mars, if all goes according to plan — jaunts that will presumably require propulsive, vertical touchdowns made with the aid of landing legs.

But SpaceX also envisions launching many Starship missions to Earth orbit — for example, to continue building out its huge Starlink broadband megaconstellation, and to help refuel other Starships that are bound for distant realms. Launch-mount landings make sense for these craft, allowing them to fly to and from Earth orbit quickly and efficiently.

1 Overview
Persistently high geopolitical and policy uncertainty is expected to weigh on euro area economic growth, slowing down the anticipated recovery. This follows slightly weaker than expected growth at the end of 2024. Both domestic and trade policy uncertainty are high. Although the baseline projection only includes the impact of new tariffs on trade between the United States and China, the negative effects of uncertainty regarding the possibility of further changes in global trade policies, particularly vis-à-vis the European Union, are assumed to weigh on euro area exports and investment. This, coupled with persistent competitiveness challenges, is assessed to lead to a further decline in the euro area’s export market share. Despite these headwinds, the conditions remain in place for euro area GDP growth to strengthen again over the projection horizon. Rising real wages and employment, in the context of a strong, albeit cooling, labour market, are expected to support a recovery in which consumption remains a key contributor to growth. Domestic demand should also be supported by an easing of financing conditions, as implied by market expectations about the future path of interest rates. The labour market should remain resilient, with the unemployment rate expected to average 6.3% in 2025, edging down to 6.2% in 2027. As some of the cyclical factors that have recently reduced productivity start to unwind, productivity is expected to pick up over the projection horizon, although structural challenges remain. Overall, annual average real GDP growth is expected to be 0.9% in 2025, and to strengthen to 1.2% in 2026 and to 1.3% in 2027. Compared with the December 2024 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for GDP growth has been revised down by 0.2 percentage points for both 2025 and 2026, but is unchanged for 2027. The weaker outlook is mainly due to downward revisions to exports and, to a lesser extent, to investment, reflecting a stronger impact of uncertainty than previously assumed, as well as expectations that competitiveness challenges will likely persist for longer than had been anticipated.[

Headline HICP inflation has increased over recent months but is projected to moderate marginally in the course of 2025 and then to decline and hover around the ECB’s inflation target of 2.0% from the first quarter of 2026. At the start of the projection horizon upward base effects in the energy component and higher food price inflation are expected to broadly offset downward impacts from a decline in HICP inflation excluding energy and food (HICPX). The rise in energy commodity prices at the turn of the year will carry over into the annual rate of change in energy prices in 2025. Although oil and gas prices are assumed to decline in line with futures prices, energy inflation is likely to continue to record positive rates, albeit below the historical average, over the entire projection horizon. In 2027 energy inflation is seen to be driven up by the introduction of new climate change mitigation measures. Food inflation is projected to rise until mid-2025, mainly driven by recent robust increases in food commodity prices, before declining to stand at an average of 2.2% in 2027. HICPX inflation is expected to start to decline in early 2025 as the effects of lagged repricing fade, wage pressures recede and the impact from past monetary policy tightening continues to feed through to consumer prices. The decline in HICPX inflation is expected to be mainly driven by a decrease in services inflation – which has thus far been relatively persistent. Overall, HICPX inflation is projected to moderate from 2.2% in 2025 to 1.9% in 2027. Wage growth should continue to follow a downward path from the current still elevated levels as inflation compensation pressures fade. Coupled with the anticipated recovery in productivity growth, this is expected to lead to significantly slower growth in unit labour costs. As a result, domestic price pressures are projected to continue to ease, with profit margins recovering over the projection horizon. External price pressures, as reflected in import prices, are expected to remain moderate assuming that EU trade tariff policies remain unchanged. Compared with the December 2024 projections, the outlook for headline HICP inflation has been revised up by 0.2 percentage points for 2025 on account of higher energy commodity price assumptions and the depreciation of the euro, while it has been marginally revised down for 2027 owing to a slightly weaker outlook for the energy component at the end of the horizon.

Trade and fiscal policy announcements after the finalisation of these projections have raised uncertainty regarding the outlook for economic growth and inflation in the euro area.","Useful links

Abstract
Economic performance of countries is closely related to corporate governance systems of companies. For this reason, economic developments are affected by a positive or negative relationship according to the system’s practices. The companies which have weak corporate governance principles can cause narrow operation in capital markets of countries. At the end of this situation, the country’s economy is influenced adversely. If enterprises have a strong governance, the companies will provide more accurate investments with external and internal financial resources. Following this, it helps to achieve more efficient economic operation for both stakeholders and management staff. As a result of that, capital market operations occur in more comprehensive and more powerful manner and the country’s economy is affected positively. In this context, article tells the importance of corporate governance in financial communication while mentioning the kinds of implementing in developing and developed countries and it investigates the increased effect on global competition.

For as long as I've been writing about PC hardware, I've hoped for a processor with an integrated GPU that was genuinely good for gaming. The AMD Ryzen AI Max 390 is that chip. It's a mobile API that's desktop-grade in a few ways, with a Radeon 8050S bringing 32 Compute Units (CUs) of graphical power and a 12-core CPU. Stuffed inside the sleek and gorgeous Asus ROG Flow Z13—a gaming tablet with all the makings of a modern gaming laptop, minus the integrated keyboard and trackpad—it should be a match made in heaven.

So why aren't I more excited?

Asus ROG Flow Z13
Before I wax overly lyrical about the chip inside the ROG Flow Z13, let's talk about the ROG Flow Z13 itself. It really is something special, being the latest generation in a lineup of gaming tablets from the ROG skunkworks. Whereas early generations of gaming tablet were hulking machines you stood little chance of holding in your hands for long periods of time, let alone handed to your child to stop them from crying, they have become more sophisticated designs over the years.

This year's Flow Z13 is definitely more what I'd call usable as a traditional tablet. It offers a 13-inch touchscreen, a generous 16:10 aspect ratio, and its 500 nit brightness is higher than many IPS panels on the market. You need that brightness when you're out and about, which, for all intents and purposes, you might be with the Flow Z13. And, to that end, it comes with Gorilla Glass 5 with a DXC coating to reduce glare on sunny days. It even has a 13 MP camera on the rear of the screen, in addition to the 5 MP front-facing camera, for when you have a mid-life crisis and start taking all your photos with a tablet instead of your phone. The front-facing camera's IR capability does mean you can use Windows Hello for swift, easy logins, and that's a neat feature to have on a tablet.

Though I won't go as far to say it's a direct iPad replacement. The main thing is that it's still absolutely massive. The 13-inch screen is as large as an iPad Pro, but where the iPad Pro is around 5.1 mm thick, the ROG Flow Z13 is three times that at 15 mm. Where the iPad Pro 13-inch is 0.582 kg, the Flow Z13 is 1.2 kg. These things are not the same, and it makes a difference if you intend to actually use this thing as a tablet.

No, the Flow Z13 is much more a 'laptop-like' device, akin to the Microsoft Surface Pro, and must be used as such. It has a built-in stand on the rear, which lets you sit it upright at a variety of angles, from nearly bolt upright to nearly laying flat. The low angles are quite useful when using the on-screen keyboard, though it's not a great experience typing on the screen when it's more upright. I feel like one of my cats pawing at the screen, which they are wont to do with a tablet like this. Don't worry, you can protect the screen from sharp mitts with the included keyboard and trackpad attachment.

For most typing tasks, you'll want to connect the magnetically attached keyboard and trackpad attachment. Again, like the Surface Pro, it offers a lightweight, fabric-backed construction and offers more tactile typing and traditional trackpad duties for the touchscreen device, while doubling up as a handy screen protector. The Flow Z13 is largely inseparable from the keyboard and trackpad accessory for this reason, which does suggest maybe bolting a better keyboard and trackpad to it would be a smart idea—I wonder what we'd call such an invention?

Yep, I'm being horribly facetious, but I've used the Flow Z13 for nearly a week now and I've yet to see the reasoning behind its tablet-like design. Shifting the hot components away from behind the keyboard and instead installing them behind the screen means the keyboard surface is slightly less hot to the touch, though it's largely a non-issue either way. There's still a processor getting nice and toasty somewhere, and while it's not under your fingers, it's still causing fans to whirr from behind the screen.

The tablet design means all the ports have shifted to beside the screen. There are two USB Type-C ports on the left-hand side of the screen, alongside a HDMI port, MicroSD slot, and proprietary power port. The power cable protrudes from the edge of the screen, and since you'll be wanting to keep this thing powered up while gaming, it's a sight you better get used to. I don't love it. You can charge via USB Type-C, with a respective wattage power brick attached, which was a relief when I left the proprietary charger on my desk in PC Gamer towers. Though a 60 W charger isn't powerful enough to keep it fully juiced up under load.

On the right hand side sits the power button, volume control, Type-A port, audio jack, and Command Center key. Through the Command Center, you can adjust power profiles, fan speeds, and more. For my testing, I stuck it in Turbo mode to let the Ryzen AI Max 390 run wild, and at least compared to some gaming laptops, the high speed whirr of the fans isn't too loud. I'd still recommend a pair of headphones, however.

I'm just going to drop the next bit of information and then very swiftly move on before you have a chance to process it fully—I'll remonstrate about it at far greater length towards the end: The ROG Flow Z13 costs $2,000. Okay, moving on!

AMD Ryzen AI Max 390
AMD Strix Halo

(Image credit: AMD)
The Ryzen AI Max 390, part of the Strix Halo family, is everything I've been dreaming of from a slice of mobile silicon. It's truly a monster, with 24 threads from 12 of the latest Zen 5 CPU cores. These are split across two six-core clusters, on two separate chiplets, known as CCDs, and each cluster comes with 6 MB of L2 cache and 32 MB of L3 cache. Altogether, we're looking at ostensibly a mobile equivalent of a Ryzen 9 9900X, albeit with lower clock speeds at just 5 GHz boost and 3.2 GHz base—this chip was binned for efficiency, not speed.

Though the CCDs on Strix Halo are equivalent to the desktop Zen 5 parts, including using the same 4 nm process node and AVX-512 extensions, they are joined together using a different interconnect. AMD needed to reduce the power consumption of the mobile chip and the desktop interconnect was the first thing to go, replaced by a lower-power option. Same bandwidth, lower latency, lower power—this interconnect has a lot going for it, though it costs more to make. That's a good thing to remember later in this review.

That only covers two of three chiplets on the Ryzen AI Max 390—there's a third, and it's much larger than the other two. This is the I/O die, containing some uncore components for the chip, which means your memory controllers, interconnects, etc. There's also a 50-TOP NPU to one side of the chip, though I could take it or leave it. As, I expect, will most people.

The highlight is what resides in the centre of the I/O die: the Radeon 8050S. This features 32 CUs and uses the RDNA 3.5 architecture, specially designed for low-power applications. This isn't the top configuration for this GPU, however. The Ryzen AI Max+ 395's Radeon 8060S has 40 CUs, and presents the best possible performance from the Strix Halo design. The Max 390 option comes in at a lower price compared to the top model, though, as we'll get to later in this review, cost doesn't appear to have been a limiting factor for the ROG Flow Z13.

The Radeon 8050S is an extraordinarily large GPU for one plonked inside a processor, and not its own discrete chip. It's over 2x larger than the Radeon 780M powering many of today's best handheld gaming PCs, and double the Radeon 890M in one of today's most powerful handhelds, the OneXFly F1 Pro. Yet there's room to spare for a more powerful model. In many ways, its desktop equivalent is the RX 7600 XT, which also has 32 CUs, hewn from the similar but not identical RDNA 3 architecture. One difference we've noted is the L1 cache, which has doubled from 128 KB on the RDNA 3 desktop card to 256 KB on the Radeon 8050S. Otherwise, L2 cache and Infinity Cache (also known as MALL) remain identical at 2 MB and 32 MB respectively.

The Infinity Cache is important in boosting bandwidth in certain situations, and more so than its desktop counterpart. This GPU has access to the same memory pool as the rest of the chip, which in the case of the ROG Flow Z13, is 32 GB of 8,000 MT/s LPDDR5X. Though shared, you can hand the iGPU a higher allocation for system memory with a few tweaks in Armoury Crate. I set the system to allocate 8 GB of system memory to the iGPU, as per Asus' recommendation, and it says it's likely to set this by default following an update in future. To make up for a bit of the bandwidth lost by not having dedicated graphics memory, the memory interface is double that of the RX 7600 XT at 256-bit.

So, in essence, what we've got in Strix Halo is a huge desktop-grade CPU, reasonably large GPU (or huge iGPU in another light), and a decent memory subsystem. Now, what does all that get me?

Performance

The ROG branding, and a price tag not that unusual for an RTX 4080 gaming laptop in the sales, come with certain expectations for gaming performance. Lower those expectations—the Radeon 8050S manages to outperform the slowest 45 W RTX 4060 mobile chips we've tested by a small margin, but is consistently slower than a middling 75 W RTX 4060. It's much slower than a 110 W RTX 4060, and if you throw any game with ray tracing into the mix, the AMD chip lags further behind. It's only occasionally faster than the 110 W RTX 4050 in the Acer Nitro 14.


Power makes a huge difference to the performance of any mobile chip, which is why I can see how the larger Max+ 395 might claim near RTX 4070 performance against a power-limited RTX 4070. Otherwise, the RX 7600 XT never got close to the RTX 4070 with GDDR6 memory, so why would almost the exact same architecture with limited bandwidth do any better? For this Max 390 chip, even a 90 W RTX 4070 in the compact ROG Zephyrus G14 absolutely trounces it.

High-end prices for sub-par gaming performance isn't selling me on the gaming tablet form factor or AMD's uber-powerful iGPU. At least the CPU component fares much better in testing, and in this regard, it's the Max 390 that's doing the trouncing.

The 12 cores of the Ryzen AI Max 390 make mincemeat out of Cinebench R23, easily outscoring every other AMD or Intel chip in the laptops I've used for comparison. Even scrolling through the benchmarking results for all 50 or so laptops we've tested, the Max 390 is only beaten by Intel's fastest 13th and 14th Gen processors in single-threaded scores, and by the power-hungry Core i9 14900HX in the most expensive laptops for multithreaded performance. It also performs well in the encoding benchmark, X264.


With impressive CPU performance and disappointing GPU performance, this form factor seems to make more sense as a powerful creative device than one intended primarily for gaming. Perhaps with a pen/stylus it would make for a powerful sculpting or illustration device. I've seen some suggest previous models have come with a pen on occasion, yet I only have a conspicuous pen-shaped hole in the box where I assume one might've sat—perhaps it varies from model to model.


I've seen Strix Halo compared to Apple's M-series in-house Arm chips, and often favourably so. In that case, I get it. It does make more sense as that sort of high-end prosumer chip that does it all with more memory than God (up to 128 GB). Imagine that in a Mac Mini lookalike. Call it the Zen Mini. Or the Strix Mini, since Asus owns the NUC design now. Now that sounds interesting. In a gaming tablet, eh, not so much.

As for power efficiency, there is a glimmer of hope here for the Max 390. It performs like a low-power RTX 4060 while using a little less power than an RTX 4060 and CPU combined. The Max 390 has a configurable TDP up to 120 W, and I measured it with an actual power consumption of 68 W while gaming. That's for both CPU and GPU, which are reported together.

For comparison, let's consider the ROG Flow X13. It has a 60 W RTX 4060 with a 45–65 W Ryzen 9 7940HS. In theory, the Flow X13 only amounts to 125 W in total, though in our testing we measured the GPU draws only 35 W on average, bringing it down a little closer to the actual measured power draw on the Flow Z13. Unfortunately I don't have the Flow X13 to hand to measure its exact CPU power draw, but it's likely landing a degree more power-hungry than the Z13 while delivering lower performance.

At 90 minutes of uninterrupted gaming, the Flow Z13 and Ryzen AI Max make a decent pairing for improved battery life versus many gaming laptops. A run time of 90 minutes isn't entirely unattainable by a regular gaming laptop—we've seen various models manage it over the years, including some with beefier GPUs than an RTX 4060—but the Flow Z13 is certainly longer lasting than a number of machines, especially other low-power 4060 machines.

Verdict
An ROG Flow Z13 (2025) set up on a desk with the detachable keyboard and charger.

(Image credit: Future)
I'd love to review the ROG Flow Z13 as a gaming tablet, a form factor that's sort-of new and sort-of exciting (they've been trying to make them happen for good few years now), but since I've found I've been using it exclusively in laptop mode for the better part of a week, I cannot lie to myself. It's a laptop with a detachable keyboard and it's no better than most laptops for that feature. It's also hella expensive.

The reason I'm not yet satisfied with either the iGPU or the Flow Z13 on the whole is that it's entirely unattainable for many PC gamers. This is not the dedicated GPU killer that it's made out to be, or was hoped to be in the lead-up to launch. It's maybe a step on that journey for AMD, a proof of concept that discrete GPU performance is possible for an iGPU, and I do really hope it leads to better things. But in this form factor, with this price and performance, there's little in the way of real-world benefit for a user. Just because other iGPUs are affordable doesn't mean this is. The performance-per-dollar value is horrible.

Even considering the impressive but not groundbreaking battery life, you're still largely going to be gaming while connected to an outlet, or need one after an hour and a half, and in this instance you need to carry around the Flow's large 200 W power brick with you. I don't remember one of those coming with my iPad.

Even if you desperately want a premium ROG laptop experience, you can buy one of the best gaming laptops out there, the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14, with an RTX 4060 and OLED screen, for just over $1000 on Best Buy. That's half the price of the Flow Z13. It's not like AMD's RDNA 3.5 architecture is really all that new and exciting. Wait around a little while longer and the RTX 50-series will be here, which is also not shaping up to be that new or exciting, but it might make for ever sterner competition for AMD's Strix Halo chips. I can't believe I'm going to say this but the RTX 50-series should at least be better value for money.

There is a split between how much I want to appreciate the performance, gram-for-gram, that the Flow Z13 offers and what the Max 390's iGPU and CPU components might mean for future chip designs, should AMD bother to make any more. I hope it does. Though my struggle is the device in front of me, which isn't all that great for this chip's inclusion. I can't give it a higher score because I think this chip might lead to something amazing in the future, and again, I hope it does. Though I'm fairly certain you won't see a current Strix Halo chip anywhere near cheap enough to make it worthwhile as a gaming laptop stand-in—this chip feels expensive and its application here is suggestive of higher costs to manufacture and implement than other contemporary chips.

Buy if...
✅ You have a real need for a powerful tablet: Say, you're a creative that dislikes Apple products and you need something portable with power. This might be a good device for that on account of the beefy CPU component, but only if you have deep pockets.

Don't buy if...
❌ You want a gaming laptop: This isn't a good proposition for gamers looking for performance-per-dollar or top-tier gaming performance on the go.

❌ You want a handheld gaming PC: This isn't as convenient as an ROG Ally X or Steam Deck. Similarly, you would get much better battery life out of one of the latest handhelds.

Would I recommend a friend buy this device? Absolutely not. This isn't a chip designed for a gaming device and it shows. Mahesh Subramony, AMD Senior Fellow, said of Strix Halo ""[it's] intended to be a workhorse"" and called it ""[almost] a Threadripper in the palm of your hands"" in an interview with Chips and Cheese. I totally agree with that, considering it shredded most of the competition in CPU testing. It is a beast in many ways, just not many of them of any large benefit to gamers with sensible credit limits.

I remain quietly hopeful of what AMD can do in the APU space that it largely dominates—larger GPUs on power-savvy chips with competitive prices, that's the dream. A chip as universally adopted as the Ryzen 7 7840HS or 8840HS is for handhelds, but with a significantly beefier GPU could put discrete GPUs out of business for low- to mid-range gaming laptops. But that's not what the Ryzen AI Max 390 offers, nor the ROG Flow Z13. For now, this is a fun experiment for gamers, but let's leave it at that for the time being.

The Flow Z13 is not a gaming device I would recommend someone actually purchase. Get back to me in a generation or two when this stellar technology is cheaper.

Asus ROG Flow Z13 (2025)
The ROG Flow Z13 is expensive and inconvenient. It would be improved by a standard laptop form factor, but I doubt even that could rescue its performance-per-dollar from its tremendous slump in games. At least the CPU is wicked, but it's only of marginal use on a 13-inch tablet, and I suspect the Strix Halo chip at its core has a far more interesting future ahead of it outside of the gaming sphere.

HiPay continues to innovate with its new Back-Office!
HiPay Console becomes the new HiPay Back-Office. Customizable, it adapts perfectly to your needs!

1- What is HiPay Console?

2- The main uses of the tool

3- Focus on the Back-Office’s modules

 

HiPay Console

HiPay Console has been created with your needs in mind.

With its unique and customizable interface, it saves you a lot of time in your daily work. Each employee can create their own back-office displaying their own information to be more operational. After logging in, the dashboard displays the widgets of your choice (over 30 available). Each widget corresponds to a KPI. This centralized view provides a clear and precise visibility of your activity.

""The widgets modularity offers a real customization of the monitoring indicators"" says Daniel SCHUMACHER - Transport, Logistics and Collection Manager TELESHOPPING

Navigating within the tool is easy, especially thanks to the right click which facilitates the consultation of data. Moreover, you can sort your data (alphabetically, numerically, ascendingly and descendingly) on the different columns present in the result tables. Which is ideal to optimize your research time!

Back_office

The dashboard offers a real-time global visibility of your activity to help you analyze your flows, results, and all other data related to payment, allowing for a simple and efficient decision making. HiPay Console improves your user experience as it is faster, more intuitive and fully customizable . Obviously, it is also responsive and available in several languages to simplify your potential international deployments.

""The interface is really nice. Congrats to the team"" says Kevin Silva from Eventeo.

 

The main uses of the tool

Navigation 

All your information is centralized in the interface in different modules:

The transaction module: gives a direct access to transactions
The financial module: lists all financial operations
The invoice module: centralizes all accounts invoices
The account module: gathers the information of your different accounts
The payment page module: offers the possibility to customize payment pages directly from the platform
Most of the information is directly displayed on the dashboard, but it is also accessible in detail through the different modules. To simplify the search, a search bar is available on all pages.

Modules

Search

Parameters and features are available to speed up searches,, such as intelligent autosuggestion, search history, filters...

Results display 

To push customization further, you can modify the tables to your liking (column order, size, etc.), save elements as favorites, modify the analysis banner, sort data, etc. You can also check at a glance your transactions key data (NB/SUM/MIN/MAX/MOY).

Exports

With HiPay Console, you can set up  exports by choosing their columns, filters, etc., which is useful to easily export your results over a certain period of time and share them with your teams.

""HiPay Console is very intuitive"" says Fanny DAS NEVES, Customer Experience Manager at Phildar

 

Focus on the Back-Office’s modules

The transaction module

The transaction module includes over 120 search filters and over 100 columns to display results!

With this module, you can use custom transaction data to perform various actions, display cart information and set up cancellation, capture and refund operations.

The financial module

The financial reporting module lists all financial operations of your merchant accounts and can display them with over 40 search filters and exportable columns.

The invoice module

The invoice module provides one-click access to every invoice from your various accounts. You can view them all directly in one place.

The account module

With this module, you will have an overview of all your accounts and their characteristics to simplify their management. You will find the user name linked to each account, the CMS used and more information!

When you click on an account, you are automatically taken to that account's notice with all of its information grouped into 3 main categories: key business figures, important account information and settlement data. The purpose of the notice is to summarize the elements that are essential to you.

The payment page module

The payment page module is designed to simplify merchant integration and increase your conversion rate with innovative and easy-to-use features. Turn your payment page into an opportunity! Find out how in this article.

Régis Pennel, Founder of L’Exception testifies about his satisfaction with the tool: ""L'Exception was looking for a model based on the simplicity and efficiency of the payment system integration. HiPay had this advantage, and not the least, that all the transactions are interfaced in our Back-office.""

Greetings all! 

I sit down to write this brimming with pride and achievement after the most impactful year in Bluprintx history. A year that marked not only the 10-year anniversary of the Bluprintx Group, but the most significant period of expansion of that decade.  

I have seen our customer offering evolve and improve with each of this year’s major milestones. We end the year better able to meet your needs, at pace, across the breadth of our multi-practice methodology.  

The Bluprintx Group welcomed the acquisitions of Definitive Results and ITG Commerce this year. Two strategic developments that enhance our global footprint and elevate value for customers, not least in North America where we’re now brimming with Marketing Automation acumen. In acquiring ITG Commerce, we introduced our brand-new Commerce practice to help growing firms improve revenue in B2B and B2C markets.  

We’re set up for your success on Adobe Commerce projects as our Adobe partnership grows ever stronger. We’re here to add value, set the pace on complex projects, and fill in the gaps with operational and strategic skillsets. But Commerce wasn’t the only practice incorporated this year…  

Hiring our first Global Director of Data & Analytics, Robert Mol, gave us the foundation to launch a new Data & Analytics practice. Integrating our wider expertise, we’re perfectly positioned to accelerate growth transformations by providing businesses with a consistent stream of actionable insights.  

Of course, these acquisitions have brought us a whole host of new Bluprintx colleagues. You’re now working with a Bluprintx Group of more than 140 team members across the globe, delivering timezone-friendly support and local market knowledge. A special welcome to Mark Humphries (Chair), Julie Redfern (Chief Financial Officer), Carly Schrager (Head of Marketing Automation Engagements) and Steven Stark (CEO, ITG Commerce) who have all fit right in to our growth-obsessed team.  

I’m immensely proud of our work getting customers AI ready. We’re putting the building blocks in place for our clients to see sustainable, long-term gains from AI in ways that serve their unique strategies and objectives. And from those foundations, employing AI where it can most make an impact – preserving at every point the essential role of human innovation and creativity.  

If you’ll indulge me, I am sure you have all heard the quote so wonderfully delivered by Jeff Goldblum: “Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn’t stop to think if they should” (and if not, I strongly suggest you find time to watch Jurassic Park this festive period). I believe we should keep this in mind with regard to artificial intelligence.  

The ethics of AI is one of the next great frontiers we are only just beginning to tackle. We must be responsible in preserving and uplifting humanity in our pursuit of growth, applying AI only where we can harness its massive potential for good.   

Thus, in a world where growth is paramount and ambitious firms will take any edge they can get, I promise you this: Bluprintx will strive for innovation and integrity in equal measure. 

At the meeting point of those two pillars we will find radical, sustainable growth that we can be proud of. Growth for our customers, growth for our people, and growth for Bluprintx. 

With that, I’ll leave you to enjoy this festive season and wish you a prosperous 2025! Whether you’re celebrating Christmas, Hannukah, or simply embracing the holiday spirit, may it be filled with joy and light. We’ll see you soon!

Lee Hackett, Bluprintx Group CEO.

Nachhaltigkeit

Menschenrechte zu achten und zu fördern sowie die planetaren Grenzen zu berücksichtigen hat oberste Priorität! So kommt Nachhaltigkeit als Handlungsprinzip ins Spiel, und bei den Rhine-Ruhr 2025 FISU World University Games spielen alle mit – auch die SDGs. Das Organisationskomitee ist demnach entschlossen, sozial-ökologische Transformationsprozesse aktiv zu beschleunigen und Bildung für nachhaltige Entwicklung (BNE) zu fördern. Ein zentrales Anliegen ist auch, die positive Einstellung zu Nachhaltigkeitsthemen in der Gesellschaft zu stärken. 

NACHHALTIGKEIT IST EIN GEMEINSCHAFTSWERK 
Um das Engagement gegenüber den SDGs und Menschenrechten zu unterstreichen, hat sich das Organisationskomitee dem Gemeinschaftswerk Nachhaltigkeit angeschlossen und das Statement von Sports for Future unterzeichnet. Darüber hinaus steht das Nachhaltigkeitsteam mit Expert:innen im Austausch und verfolgt den aktuellen Stand der Forschung. Verstärkung hat auch das Team Rhine-Ruhr 2025 mit Domitila Barros bekommen - gemeinsam geht es darum Nachhaltigkeit eine Stimme zu verleihen und zu motivieren, sich für nachhaltiges Handeln und Menschenrechte einzusetzen!

摘要
脑机接口技术在教育、医疗等领域已经得到了广泛应用，所具有的“非接触式的信息传播”“人体机能的深度强化”“高效的数据传输”等诸多机能对于赋能情报活动开展具有一定的现实意义。通过分析脑机接口技术对于情报活动存在的具体功能，在情报活动中应用脑机接口技术会存在的现实风险，构建了从原则指导到规则锚定的合规保护机制，力求有效保障脑机接口技术在情报领域中的全面应用。此外，在应用过程中还需要坚持预防性利益保护原则、利益位阶保护原则、惩罚与奖励相结合原则，从保护个人自决权、制定隐私合规保护策略、强化情报机构的监督责任、完善数据安全审查制度、制定数据合规保护奖惩机制这5个方面，消解脑机接口技术在情报领域应用中可能面临的风险。

WARWICK, R.I., Sept. 10, 2024 — A new report from InsureMyTrip ranks the most popular international destinations by state. The data shows 31 states favor trips to Mexico, while other states prefer visiting Bahamas and Italy. Results are based on all travel insurance purchases for international trips departing in 2024.

Summary:

Mexico dominates the rankings as the top destination for about 60% of states.
Italy is a popular destination for 2024 – making the top 5 for every state except Oklahoma, Tennessee, West Virginia, and Wyoming.
Travel insurance customers from Hawaii pick Japan as a favorite destination.
Bahamas, The United Kingdom, and Canada all making strong showings in the rankings.
Top 5 International Destinations State by State:




Travel Insurance for International Trips

According to InsureMyTrip, 87% of customers choose a Comprehensive Travel Insurance Policy for trips abroad. This policy provides a variety of benefits including medical coverage, emergency travel services, baggage protection, trip cancellation and trip interruption coverage.

Emergency medical coverage is especially important for international trips because most domestic health insurance plans do not cover medical bills outside of the country.

Sondos Al Qattan has ‘free right’ to her opinion, says Kanoo Group chairman
Mishal Kanoo advised the Kuwaiti influencer Sondos Al Qattan to apologise, but says ‘clearer’ laws are needed for domestic workers

Mishal Kanoo advised the Kuwaiti influencer Sondos Al Qattan to apologise, but says 'clearer' laws are needed for domestic workers.
Mishal Kanoo advised the Kuwaiti influencer Sondos Al Qattan to apologise, but says 'clearer' laws are needed for domestic workers.
Kuwaiti influencer Sondos Al Qattan, who sparked worldwide outrage over controversial comments about domestic workers, has a ‘free right’ to her opinion, according to the chairman of Bahrain-based family conglomerate Kanoo Group.

Mishal Kanoo, one of the Gulf’s most prominent businessman, told Arabian Business that Al Qattan should be able to express her opinion.

“This is her opinion. I don’t support it, but she is fully within her right to have her opinion and she should have the free space to say it,” he said.

Al Qattan, a makeup artist with 2.3 million followers on Instagram, criticised Kuwait’s legislation designed to protect the right of Filipina domestic workers.

“The new laws that have been passed [in Kuwait] are like a pathetic film. For her [domestic worker] to take a day off every week, that’s four days a month. Those are the days that she’ll be out. And we don’t know what she’ll be doing on those days, with her passport on her,” she said in a video in July, adding, “How can you have a ‘servant’ at home who keeps their own passport with them?”

The backlash saw a number of brands, including MAC Cosmetics and Anastasia Beverly Hills, cut ties with the social media star. This led Al Qattan to release another video where she states that the matter has been blown out of proportion, and that there are “more important things in life, like Botox”.

While Kanoo disagrees with Al Qattan, he believes laws surrounding domestic workers should be made ‘clearer’ as a household cannot be compared to a regular, corporate business environment.

“I think a full discussion needs to take place to help domestic workers know their rights, but also help employers know what they can legally do. I mean, no one should work 7 days a week, but a house is not like a business from 9 to 5. [There needs to be] a clearer way to be fair to both employer and employees,” he said.

The chairman added that he advises influencers like Al Qattan to think before they speak.

“We have an Arabic poem that says, ‘Your tongue is your horse. If you take care of it, it will take care of you. If you betray it, it will betray you’,” he said.

In a tweet on July 26, Kanoo had urged Al Qattan to apologise for her comments.

“She just doesn’t get it. Just apologize for the stupid statements and try to be a better person. But no. she had to defend her position. When will she learn?” he said.

Monitoring Docker Containers on AWS ECS with Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring

By Splunk
Share on X
Share on Facebook
Share on LinkedIn
Containers have become the preferred unit of abstraction for developers to deploy application code at a time when speed and scale are requirements to drive competitive advantage. This is especially true in software-driven organizations building competitive advantage through innovative customer-facing applications linked to digital transformation initiatives. However, monitoring containerized applications is easier said than done.

We strive to ensure out of the box integrations with open-source container technologies including Docker, Kubernetes, as well as all the major public cloud container services – such as those offered by AWS, GCP, and Azure. In this blog post, we’ll elaborate on how you can use Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring to monitor Amazon ECS, for which we have some very exciting updates.

Monitoring Containers with Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring Streaming Analytics
The highly dynamic and ephemeral nature of containerized environments makes them very hard to monitor using traditional infrastructure monitoring or APM solutions. With hundreds – if not thousands – of components being spun up and down every day or even hour, batch-based monitoring solutions cannot keep up with the churn and in many cases cannot even see the new components, let alone enabling multi-dimensional real-time analysis.

The Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring streaming analytics engine – SignalFlow – is the only one that can keep up with the dynamic nature of containerized environments without compromising performance and being overwhelmed by alert storms. Some of our customers are running the most demanding container based production environments in the industry, with millions of components being churned on a daily basis. Learn more about them here.

What is Amazon ECS?
Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) is Amazon’s container orchestration service for Docker containers. ECS allows you to automate the deployment and scheduling of containers without having to install and operate your own container orchestration and cluster management software. ECS automatically deploys containers in EC2 hosts running in a customer’s VPC. It is integrated with several popular AWS services, including Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring.

You launch applications on an ECS cluster by defining, scheduling, and running tasks, with each task running up to 10 containers. Multiple copies of the same task can be simultaneously maintained with a service, which runs a specified number of task instances, and restarts those that become unhealthy or stop unexpectedly.

AWS CloudWatch provides metrics on CPU and memory utilization for your entire ECS cluster as well as on the services within your clusters. Additional system-level metrics are provided depending on whether you use AWS Fargate to launch your services. Users not using Fargate own and monitor the EC2 instances that containers run on, so CPU and utilization metrics are available at the cluster, service, and task level.

Connecting Splunk to Amazon ECS
Several options exist for monitoring Amazon ECS with Splunk.

For basic infrastructure and container monitoring, we provide the Amazon CloudWatch integration. AWS CloudWatch collect standard metrics on containers and other ECS constructs:

CPU and Memory utilization
I/O, such as reads, writes
Network – throughput, drops, and errors

Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring will ingest data through the Cloudwatch Integration and automatically populate built-in dashboards and the Infrastructure Navigator to quickly visualize metrics. In most cases, CloudWatch is configured by default to aggregate and report metrics at 5-minute resolution (with a few specific services reporting at 1-minute). Visualizations and alerts based on this data will update accordingly.

For greater insight into the services running in your containers, as well as finer-grained monitoring of container metrics, you can now use the Smart Agent, our open-source metrics agent with seamless installation and dynamic configuration of metrics. This is a new option that we just recently made available. Since its introduction, the Smart Agent has become a very popular option for sending data to Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring because it greatly reduces the time spent setting up metrics plug-ins by providing automatic service discovery and configuration for monitoring content. We are excited to now make it available also for ECS deployments!

As opposed to populating dashboards only for Amazon ECS, the Smart Agent automatically detects containers in your environment and the applications running in them, then generates the relevant service dashboards based on what was discovered.

The Smart Agent is also capable of submitting metrics to Splunk at 1-second resolution, which makes it extremely useful for monitoring environments with a high degree of churn (i.e. your containers constantly appear and disappear for seconds at a time due to auto scaling or load balancing).

Monitoring Amazon ECS with AWS CloudWatch
Pre-built dashboards are generated that measure metrics for each individual ECS cluster and the services running in it, as well as your ECS deployment as a whole. Below are a few examples.

Active Clusters
For an overall view of your ECS deployment, Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring provides charts displaying the number of active clusters, services and tasks. Charts also appear that highlight top clusters and services by resource utilization.




Cluster Utilization
Each minute, ECS container agent calculates the % of CPU and memory that is currently being used for each task running on the container instance. Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring provides a ECS cluster dashboard that shows not only CPU and memory utilization for an entire cluster, but also by specific services with the highest resource utilization. A count of running services and tasks is provided as well.



Service Utilization
You can also drill down to a particular ECS service to see the number of tasks being run as well as CPU and memory utilization.



Monitoring Containers with the Smart Agent
Our Smart Agent will automatically discover containers deployed via ECS, then provide a heatmap view showing your entire fleet of containers or compute instances, with dashboards displaying aggregated system metrics across your environment. You can also select an individual container to see the specific applications running on it. It’s important to note as well that Smart Agent supports all ECS container networking modes: host, bridge and awsvpc.

Real-time Resource Navigation
When the Smart Agent is installed on your compute instances, a heatmap view is generated that sorts instances according to a variety of system metrics (cpu/memory/disk utilization, network traffic, disk operations). This view can easily be adjusted to group instances by dimensions such as AWS availability zone or by specific services that they support.



Automatically Discovered Containers
Active containers are automatically detected by the Smart Agent, allowing Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring to populate dashboards with individual container metrics.




Dynamically Configured Service Dashboards
Because Smart Agent also detects the services running in each container, dashboards are automatically populated with relevant metrics. In this example, the Smart Agent is able to detect a Docker container running Elasticsearch, and generates content for each.","Splunk Blogs

第165回「生成AIが雇用に与える影響」
印刷
岩本 晃一
リサーチアソシエイト／立命館アジア太平洋大学
1　はじめに
2022年11月、Chat-GPTが世の中に登場したとき、世界中は、その技術水準の高さに驚くとともに、内包する多くの課題を含め、賛否両論の大議論が巻き起こった。だが、時間が経過するに従って、人々は新しい技術を冷静に客観視し、規制やガイドラインを議論しつつ、是々非々で受け入れ始めている。開発メーカーは、生成AIに対する市場が大きいと見て、開発に加速度をつけ、多種多様な新商品を意欲的に市場に投入している。日本政府も開発を強力に支援する方針を打ち出している。

だが生成AIに対する多くの人々の社会学的な最重要関心事は、依然として、雇用への影響である。2013年、マイケル・オズボーンが、AIが雇用に与える影響の試算結果を発表し、それを契機に世界中で、「AIと雇用」に関する研究ブームが巻き起こり、大量の論文、試算値、報告書などが発表された。その発表は、2014～2017年頃がピークであった。

生成AIが登場した今回もまた、雇用への影響が、生成AIに関する人々の関心の中で最も高いテーマであることに変わりはない。だが、かつてのような研究ブームは発生していない。「AIと雇用」に関する推計手法がある程度確立したため、突拍子もない数字が出てくることはないと、専門家たちは想定しているためであろう。推計手法が確立していなかった2014～2017年頃、9割の雇用が奪われるという数字を大真面目に発表した研究者もいたくらいだ。

生成AIが2022年11月に登場して以降、多くのシンクタンク、コンサルタント会社、調査会社、金融機関などが、雇用に与える影響の推計値を発表したが、2014～2017年頃の研究ブーム時と同様、その多くは計算の根拠が示されず、論文に必要な「再現性」を具備した内容になっていない。いわゆる大部分が評論の域を出ていない。論文としての水準を確保している推計値は、今のところ、OECD (2023)、ILO (2023)、IMF (2024)の3つの国際機関が発表した論文くらいしか見当たらない。とはいえ、Chat-GPTが発表されてわずか1年2カ月で、ほぼ「生成AIと雇用」に関する最終結論のようなものが出そろった。これらをもって、本テーマに関する研究はほとんど終了した、もしくはピークを越えた、といえよう。

本稿では、この3つの国際機関が発表した推計値を中心に、「生成AIと雇用」に関して概要を述べてみたい。

2　2014～2017年頃に発表された推計値のオーバービュー
2013年、英国オックスフォード大学教授マイケル・オズボーン（Michael Osborne）が発表した論文（Frey, C. B., & Osborne, M. A. (2013)）は、世界に大きな衝撃を与えた。AIが導入されれば、47%の雇用が影響を受ける可能性があるとの試算結果であった。日本では、AIが半分の雇用を奪う、などとショッキングな表現方法でメディアが取り上げ、AIは怖い技術だというプロパガンダが日本国民の間に広まった。そのためAI研究に予算が配分されず、日本がAI分野で世界に大きく後れを取る要因になったとも言われている。

この論文を契機に「AIと雇用」に関する研究ブームが巻き起こり、世界中で活発な研究成果の発表が相次いだが、日本では、メディアが依然として2013年のマイケル・オズボーンの発表だけを取り上げ、世界の研究の進捗を日本国民に伝えることがなかった。やがて、一通りの研究発表が成されると研究ブームは収束した。

「AIと雇用」という研究テーマは、英国オックスフォード大学マイケル・オズボーンとドイツ・マンハイムZEW研究所（Leibniz Centre for European Economic Research in Mannheim）メラニー・アーンツ（Dr. Melanie Arntz）との論争であると言っても過言ではない。メラニー・アーンツは、47%を否定し、米国では9%、ドイツでは12%であると発表した（2015年6月）。そして2人の論争を横目で見ながら、OECDの研究チームが定期的に研究成果を発表している。主要なプレーヤーはこの2人にOECD、米国MIT教授ディビッド・オーター（David H. Autor）を加えた4者である。

これら4者以外、世界中でさまざまな研究者やシンクタンク、調査会社、コンサルタント会社、金融機関が膨大な成果を発表したが、4者の論争の亜流、傍流でしかない。

マイケル・オズボーンとメラニー・アーンツの研究の決定的な違いは、推計の基になっているデータベースの差である。オズボーンは、O＊NET（＊）を用い、アーンツはPIAAC（＊）を用いている。2人の論争の根本は、どちらのデータを用いるのが正しいのかという論争に帰結すると言っても良い。

（＊）「O＊NET」は、Occupational Information Networkの略で、米国労働省雇用訓練局が1998年に開設した職業情報の総合サイトである。誰でもアクセスが可能で、約1,000種の職種について詳細なガイド情報を提供している。

（＊）国際成人力調査（PIAAC、Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies）は、経済協力開発機構（OECD）の成人のスキルを評価する世界規模の調査である。この調査はOCED各国の知識基盤社会における読解力、数的思考力、そして問題解決能力のスキルを評価し、各国国民のこれらのスキルを向上させるための情報を提供するのが主目的である。労働力人口（16歳から65歳まで）に焦点を合わせたこの調査は、2013年10月8日に初めて公表された。

筆者は2人と直接会って意見交換したが、どう見てもメラニー・アーンツの言い分の方に優位性がある。彼女は、「自動運転車が実用化されたからといって、世界中のタクシードライバー全員が、いきなり翌日に全て自動運転車に替わる、などという想定はおかしい、1%、2%・・と順に切り替わっていくと考える方が妥当である」「タクシードライバーといっても、その仕事をしている時間帯は人によって千差万別であり、それ以外の時間帯に別の仕事をしている人もいれば、時間の過ごし方が人によって全て違う。一人一人の時間の過ごし方を記述しているPIACCが現実的である。タクシードライバーという職業1本だけで統計を取ると、世界中のタクシードライバーが全員同じ働き方をしていることになり、そのようなデータを用いることはおかしい」と言っていたが、確かにそうだ。

これに対してオズボーンは、「自分は技術的な可能性を示しただけに過ぎない」と言う。自動運転車が出現すると、時間軸を考えなければいつかは世界中のタクシードライバー全員が職を失う『可能性』がある、ということは確かである。間違っていない。オズボーンの推計は、時間軸を考えず、あまりに単純すぎてラフ過ぎていただけである。要はメディアが、「半分の職がなくなる」などという短絡的かつプロパガンダ的な表現を繰り返して、人々に誤解を与えたことの方が責任が重い。

オズボーンの推計は、他にもさまざまな批判を浴びた。主要な点を挙げると、①推計値を示しているのに、推計値の目標年次がない、すなわち時間軸がない、②雇用が失われるマイナスの影響を出しただけで、AI産業が興って雇用が増えるプラスの影響に言及していない、などである。

オズボーンの推計は、単純化し過ぎていてラフ過ぎた。同氏の趣旨をきちんと理解すれば、それはそれで構わないのだが、世間の要求水準の高さがさまざまな批判となって彼に向かった。同氏はそうした批判に応えるべく2017年に改良版の推計値を公表した。だが、O＊NETを用いるという点は、研究の根幹に関わる部分であり、変更していない。もしPIAACを用いれば、アーンツの後塵を拝するだけになってしまうからだ。

Bakhshi, H., Downing, J., Osborne, M. and Schneider, P. (2017).,では、“現在の米国 [英国] の労働力の9.6%（8.0%）が、労働力のシェアが増加する可能性が非常に高い職業に就いており、18.7%（21.2%）が減少する可能性が非常に高い職業に就いていることがわかりました。”　（英語原文を筆者翻訳）","RIETI 独立行政法人経済産業研究所（RIETI Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry）日本語

Abstract
A United Nations report has revealed that 17% to 20% of global industrial wastewater pollution comes from textile dyeing and finishing processes, where toxic substances infiltrate the soil through the water cycle. This positions the fashion industry as the second-largest polluting industry in the world. Currently, due to consumers’ green consumption behaviors are influenced by the source of label information, recognition of eco-labels, and academic literature contains limited research on the design and perspectives of green information integrated into clothing tags. Therefore, based on S–O-R model, this research explored the correlation between consumers’ perception on the green information, how much they are involved in it, and their environmental awareness. The research was conducted by using purposive and snowball sampling. A total of 300 questionnaires were distributed via postal mail and online platforms. After excluding 36 invalid responses, 264 valid questionnaires were retained. The data were analyzed by adopting SPSS 20.0 and AMOS 25. Based on this analysis, the study summarizes the key factors of green information that enhance consumers’ environmental awareness and identifies design elements in green clothing tags that can further promote environmental awareness. According to our research findings, green information has a significant and direct negative influence on consumers' environmental awareness. However, green-designed clothing tags significantly positively influence consumers' environmental awareness. Moreover, when green information is conveyed through green-designed clothing tags, it exerts a significant and indirect positive influence on environmental protection. This demonstrates that the green information displayed on clothing tags enables consumers to easily grasp the environmental message, sparks their interest in environmental protection, and consequently raises their environmental awareness. It is expected that by raising consumers’ environmental awareness, this study can also contribute to can serve as a pre-purchase reminder, effectively promoting environmental protection by significantly reducing unnecessary purchases, accumulation, and eventual disposal by consumers. Accordingly, it will help decrease carbon emissions from clothing production, minimize resource waste, and enhance the quality of the environment, resources, and the health of all living beings, including humans.","Discover content

JAKARTA, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto's ambitious multi-billion dollar programme to provide free meals to more than a quarter of his people was officially underway on Monday, officials said, with 570,000 mouths to feed on its opening day.
Despite being the centrepiece of an election campaign that catapulted Prabowo to power last year, the scheme was rolled out with little fanfare on Monday, with no official launch and just 190 kitchens involved in preparing the first meals to school children and pregnant women in more than 20 provinces.

The free meal plan will be a Herculean logistical effort when in full swing, with a target by 2029 of reaching 82.9 million of the country's 280 million population.
Prabowo's signature policy has been controversial, however, with previous estimates of its cost of $28 billion over five years triggering concern among some economists that it could dent Indonesia's hard-won reputation for fiscal prudence.
Prabowo has defended the programme and last month described it as strategic in countering child malnutrition and spurring growth in Indonesia's economy at regional level. It is estimated to cost 71 trillion rupiah ($4.39 billion) in its first stage this year, providing meals for 15 million people.

At an elementary school in West Jakarta, staff carried food trays to class and students picked them up one by one, finding rice, fried chicken, fried tofu, beans, and an orange.
Hana Yohana, a parent of a first grader, said she hoped the programme continues as it made her morning routine easier.
""Thank God, this helps us. We normally had to work hard preparing food every morning, and now we don't,"" she said.
The government and military, who will help prepare and distribute the meals, have been running pilot programmes where they have handed out trays of food including rice, chicken and milk.
The number of meal recipients will gradually expand to 3 million by March and more throughout the year, according to Dedek Prayudi, a spokesperson for Prabowo's office.
Dedek said milk would be given but not every day. Indonesia has imported dairy cows from Australia to boost milk production.

Se trata de las empresas ByD y Tsingshan, que desistieron en la construcción de sus plantas en la zona norte de Chile. Al respecto, Corfo difundió un comunicado donde explicó las determinaciones de las firmas chinas y defendió la política de litio del Gobierno. NOTICIAS RELACIONADAS Duro golpe a la industrialización del litio: Las chinas BYD y Tsingshan no concretarán millonarios proyectos Gobierno lamenta que firmas chinas desistan de proyectos de litio y atribuye decisión a ""razones comerciales"" Según Corfo, ""la Estrategia Nacional del Litio está en plena implementación y entrega certezas respecto del desarrollo de la industria del litio a futuro en Chile, con múltiples proyectos productivos en los próximos años. Entre estos destacan la alianza público-privada Codelco-SQM en el Salar de Atacama y el proyecto Salares Altoandinos que lidera Enami, que tendrá también socios privados, además de otros proyectos liderados por privados que se habilitarán con la entrega de Contratos Especiales de Operación de Litio (CEOL) que lleva adelante el Ministerio de Minería"". ""Así, se estima que la Estrategia permitirá duplicar la producción de litio en Chile en los próximos 10 años"", agregó la Corporación. Junto con esto, indicó que ""las empresas seleccionadas por Corfo han visto afectadas sus decisiones de inversión por las condiciones de mercado global, que ha mostrado una fuerte caída de precios respecto de 2022. A ello se suma el hecho de que la cuota de litio disponible en este llamado y sus condiciones de precio están estipulados en el contrato vigente con SQM, el cual expira en 2030"". ""En el caso de BYD, la empresa ha manifestado las dificultades que le han impedido avanzar en su concreción, asociadas a factores de mercado. Corfo ha solicitado, reiteradamente a la empresa, mayores antecedentes así como una posible redefinición del plan de implementación, el que siempre debe cumplir con las bases del llamado realizado en 2022"", sostuvo. Según la Corporación, ""durante este proceso, Corfo ha realizado variados esfuerzos para apoyar el proyecto como son las gestiones ante el Ministerio de Bienes Nacionales para identificar posibles terrenos fiscales en Antofagasta para la instalación de la futura planta. El proceso avanzó adecuadamente hasta que, en enero de 2025, BYD Chile desechó la alternativa de terreno seleccionada por ellos mismos"". En cuanto al proyecto de Yongqing, ""se dio por desistido debido a que no constituyó en Chile la empresa que debía desarrollarlo en los términos que establecían las bases del proceso. El requisito de constitución de la sociedad por acciones por parte del postulante fue establecido como una condición para mantener la calidad de Productor Especializado y como una causal de pérdida de la calidad de Productor Especializado, sin indemnización alguna"". ""Cabe hacer notar que la empresa Yongqing Technology Co. pidió ser reemplazada por Eternal Tsingshan Group. Co. Ltd. lo que no fue posible ya que, esta otra empresa, no participó de su propuesta bajo ninguna de las opciones reconocidas en las Bases del Procedimiento, ni fue evaluada por Corfo, para comprobar que cumplía con las condiciones que se tuvieron en cuenta al seleccionar la propuesta"", indicó. Asimismo, afirmó que ""las complejidades para avanzar en este tipo de políticas no son nuevas. De hecho, en 2018, Corfo seleccionó a las empresas Molymet, Posco-Samsung SDI y Sichuan Fulin para desarrollar proyectos industriales en Chile con acceso a litio a precio preferente, en el marco de un contrato con Albemarle. Sin embargo, los tres proyectos no se concretaron por distintas razones"". ""Atendidas las nuevas condiciones del mercado y con la Estrategia Nacional del Litio en plena implementación, lo que asegura un fuerte desarrollo de esta industria en los próximos años, Corfo abrió el 30 de abril recién pasado, un nuevo concurso de Productor Especializado. Esta vez el llamado está asociado al contrato con Abemarle y busca seleccionar un proyecto de valor agregado en Chile que aproveche la cuota de precio preferente incluida en dicho contrato, que rige hasta 2043 y ofrece, por tanto, un período de implementación y retorno de las inversiones mucho más largo"", acotó. Además, el organismo señaló que ""en los últimos dos años, Corfo ha conocido del interés y ha recibido múltiples consultas de empresas internacionales sobre este beneficio y se espera contar con varios interesados en adjudicarse la cuota disponible. Contribuyen a estas buenas perspectivas el hecho de que el mercado hoy ha tendido a una estabilización de precios, que el suministro de litio para este proyecto está asegurado hasta 2043 y que en el contrato con Albemarle se estableció, además la modalidad de precio preferente, una forma alternativa para que el Productor Especializado y Albemarle alcancen un acuerdo de precios respecto de la cuota asignada"". ""A todo lo anterior se suma que, con la Estrategia Nacional del Litio en marcha, existirán en el futuro varios otros proyectos de explotación de litio en el país que harán más atractivas este tipo de inversiones"", cerró Corfo. ¿Encontraste algún error?

680,https://www.grandnational.fans/news/aintree-going/,"2025 Grand National | OFFICIAL AINTREE GOING
GOOD TO SOFT
This iconic race, a pinnacle of British horse racing, is as unpredictable as it is thrilling. Yet, one factor that will significantly influence the outcome is the 'Official Going,' a term that describes the ground conditions on the racecourse.

While the official 'Going' has remained fairly consistent over the course of the three-day festival, knowing what it means still matters for anyone interested in the Grand National.

In this article, we explore the intricacies of 'Going,' its impact on horse racing, and why it holds particular importance for the Grand National.

What is 'Official Going'?
In the world of horse racing, few terms are as pivotal as 'Official Going.' This phrase describes the ground conditions at a racecourse, determined by the Clerk of the course.

The 'Going' is assessed based on the amount of moisture in the ground, which can significantly affect a horse's performance.

To provide a more scientific measurement, the industry introduced the GoingStick in 2007. This device is poked into the ground, and depending on how far it goes in, a numerical reading indicates the moisture level.

Before the advent of the GoingStick, clerks used more rudimentary methods, such as the heel of their wellies or the pointy end of a walking stick, to gauge the ground conditions.

Different types of 'Going' range from 'Firm,' often found in the dry summer months, to 'Heavy,' which is more common in the winter.

These conditions are so crucial that they can influence how a horse runs and where and when a horse should run, guiding the decisions of trainers and owners.

How the 'Going' is Measured

The Importance of 'Going' in Horse Racing
Understanding the 'Going' is not just a matter of jargon or tradition; it's a critical factor that can make or break a race for a horse. The ground conditions significantly affect a horse's performance in several ways:

Speed and Stamina
The 'Going' can influence how fast or slow a horse runs. For instance, firmer ground typically allows for faster race times. In contrast, softer, heavier ground can be more taxing on a horse's stamina.

Decision-Making for Trainers and Owners
The 'Going' reports are vital for trainers and owners when deciding when and where to race a horse.

Some horses are specialists, excelling on specific types of ground, while others are more versatile, adapting to various conditions. Knowing the 'Going' can help make strategic race participation decisions.

Betting and Odds
For bettors, understanding the 'Going' is crucial for making informed wagers. The ground conditions can affect the odds and potentially the race's outcome, making it an essential factor to consider when placing bets.

Its importance cannot be overstated, especially for a race as unpredictable and challenging as the Grand National.

Grand National Going, scratched, coronation cup
Types of 'Going' and Their Impact
Here's a breakdown of the different types of 'Going' and what they mean for horses and races:

Hard
This type of ground is the firmest on the scale of ground conditions in horse racing. However, it's worth noting that ""Hard"" going is relatively rare in modern British horse racing.

Most racecourses will water the course to avoid such hard conditions, aiming for a safer, more forgiving surface like ""Good"" or ""Good to Soft.""

Firm
Firm ground is often encountered during summer months when the racing surface is dry. This type of ground allows for quicker race times but can be hard on a horse's joints and ligaments.

Good to Firm
This is a slightly slower surface than firm ground. Racecourse staff may add water to the track to achieve this condition, especially if no rain is forecasted.

Good
This is the most common type of ground and is considered the fairest for the majority of horses. Racecourses often aim for this condition to attract larger fields and offer a balanced challenge.

Good to Soft
Typically found in winter, this ground holds a fair amount of water but is still mostly good. It offers a bit more give underfoot, which some horses prefer.

Soft
Common in the jumps season, soft ground is more challenging for horses to run on. The ground is deeper and moister, leading to slower race times. Some horses, however, excel on soft ground.

Heavy
This type of ground is a real test of stamina. It's often very wet and hard to run on, and only a few horses relish these conditions.

Understanding these different types of 'Going' is crucial for anyone involved in horse racing, whether you're a trainer deciding where to race your horse or a bettor looking to place a well-informed wager.

'Going' and the Grand National: Aintree's Approach
When it comes to the Grand National, the importance of 'Going' takes on an added dimension.

Aintree Racecourse, the host of this iconic event, has its own set of challenges that make the ground conditions even more critical.

Aintree's Safety Measures
In recent years, Aintree has been proactive in maintaining ground conditions that prioritise the safety of horses and jockeys.

The course aims for 'Good' or 'Good to Soft' conditions, which are generally considered safer than 'Firm' ground. To achieve this, the Clerk of the Course may decide to water the track, ensuring that the ground is optimal for racing.

The British Weather Factor
However, the unpredictable British weather can upend Aintree's best-laid plans. The Grand National is run in early spring, a season known for its erratic weather.

A sudden period of rain could turn the ground 'Heavy,' making it more challenging for the course to revert to 'Good to Soft.' While watering can make the ground softer, removing excess moisture is a more complicated task. Strong winds can help dry up the course, but they are far from a reliable solution.

The Complexity of the Course
The Grand National stands apart from typical races; its marathon length and unique fence characteristics elevate the importance of ground conditions beyond that of a standard steeplechase.

The 'Going' can affect how these challenges are navigated, adding another layer of complexity to this already demanding event.

In summary, 'Going' is more than just a term to be glossed over when discussing the Grand National.

It's a crucial factor influencing the race's outcome, affecting everything from horse and jockey safety to betting odds.

Aintree Racecourse takes significant measures to control the 'Going.' Still, the British weather always has the final say, making this one of the many variables that add to the Grand National's unpredictability.","

This is the fifth part of a series in which we follow the journey that brought Playwell Bricks’ own Jason Pyett from a stay-at-home-Dad to bespoke models designer to the CEO of an international design company. In Parts One through Four, we’ve watched Pyett’s passion for bricks evolve into workshops, robotics, his not-for-profit, and in this part, we’ll journey with Pyett as he gets his first-ever custom set commission.

Pyett loves a challenge. He calls them an “impossible balloon” and explains that “I always set up an impossible balloon and then I go and beat it,” proving it was possible all along.

One day, while he was sorting bricks with one of the volunteers at the local school, they turned to him and asked, “Do you think you can ever make money doing this?”

Pyett shook his head. “Absolutely not.” Still, he kept thinking about it, realizing that he’d found his next impossible balloon.

In the meantime, Pyett was experimenting with content for the Playwell Bricks YouTube channel. He discovered his strength lay in instructional videos and leaned into that kind of content. Soon, he was posting videos showing how to use Stud.io software to fill a niche that he knew up-and-coming brick designers needed.

“And I was posting my own experiments on social media every day. Weird, wonky things that were popping into my head.” His first client saw those experiments and Pyett’s YouTube videos and approached him, offering a commission to build the Argonath from Lord of the Rings in genuine LEGO® bricks.

Pyett had no idea if he could do the design, but that was just another impossible balloon. “I just said yes and figured it out along the way.”

There’s an anecdote originating from the book Art & Fear by Boyles and Orland that sums up Pyett’s philosophy about designing. As the story goes, a pottery class is divided into two sections. The first section is told that they will be graded on the quality of a single pot, while the second will be graded on how many pots they produce. The first group spends all their time working out how to make a single, perfect pot, while the second just got to work making the things. In the end, the second group produced the best pots because instead of striving for perfection, they practiced their craft rather than seeking perfection. Like the second group, Pyett just got to work and didn’t waste time worrying about perfection.

He started with the head of the Argonath. “I figured if I could do the head, then I could do the rest, because the head was going to be the most difficult part. And then it was just continuing out, building the robes in ways I’ve never thought of before.”

“The water I wanted to have actual depth. I didn’t just want to use flat tiles, so the water is actually three plates deep and you can look in and see colors underneath the surface,” Pyett says with pride. “It’s not just blue.”

It took Pyett three months to finish the digital design, and another three months to finish the physical build of the Argonath. He’s still proud of that design years later, while admitting, “I can see room for improvement, but it was quite good.”

Are you curious how Pyett went from his first commission to the CEO of a well-respected, international design company? Stay tuned in this space for the Playwell Journey: Part Six, where Pyett gathers the original Playwell Bricks team together and lands a major corporate client.

The first group spends all their time working out how to make a single, perfect pot, while the second just got to work making the things. In the end, the second group produced the best pots because instead of striving for perfection, they practiced their craft rather than seeking perfection. Like the second group, Pyett just got to work and didn’t waste time worrying about perfection.

He started with the head of the Argonath. “I figured if I could do the head, then I could do the rest, because the head was going to be the most difficult part. And then it was just continuing out, building the robes in ways I’ve never thought of before.”

“The water I wanted to have actual depth. I didn’t just want to use flat tiles, so the water is actually three plates deep and you can look in and see colors underneath the surface,” Pyett says with pride. “It’s not just blue.”

It took Pyett three months to finish the digital design, and another three months to finish the physical build of the Argonath. He’s still proud of that design years later, while admitting, “I can see room for improvement, but it was quite good.”

Are you curious how Pyett went from his first commission to the CEO of a well-respected, international design company? Stay tuned in this space for the Playwell Journey: Part Six, where Pyett gathers the original Playwell Bricks team together and lands a major corporate client.

About Miami
Miami is one of the most touristic cities in the U.S. Located at the southern tip of Florida, Miami's proximity to Latin America and the Caribbean has also made it home to many immigrants from these regions. You can see, taste, and feel a vibrant Latin culture in this city. Spanish is just as widely spoken as English. Miami is a joyous city with its white sandy beaches, turquoise-colored water, a vibrant entertainment scene, and lively cafes and restaurants from world cuisines all along the coast. 
 
Miami enjoys a tropical climate. Warm temperatures predominate year-round, but there is more rain in the summer. The beaches are open even in the fall and spring months.  
 
Miami has a relatively high crime rate, and traffic accidents occur frequently. Do not forget those statistics if you want to rent a car.  The city is serviced by Miami International Airport, and you can reach the city center by either taxi or shuttle.

Transportation to Miami City Center from Airport
Dade Collier Training and Transition Airport
Miami is one of the most popular cities in the United States of America and it is one of the cities on the Atlantic coast of Florida. Miami, a world-famous city in the field of tourism and art, has the feature of being the place where especially most of the Latino celebrities live.

Most of the Latin movies and TV series in the country are produced in this city. Miami, one of the most important tourism cities in the world, has 5 international airports.

Rail System
It is possible to reach the city center from the airport with the rail system lines in Miami consisting of Downtown and the Miami Beach located on two sides of a gulf formed by the Atlantic Ocean.

To do this, you need to get on the tram called “Metrorail” which departs from the airport and get off the tram after 7 stations to board the bus number 5100 from Dadeland. This journey takes about 40 minutes. Similarly, the bus 5100 also goes to the South Beach in Miami Beach.

Bus
There are also the bus services between the airport and the city center. You can reach Miami Beach and the city center called ‘Downtown’ by taking the buses 7, 42 and 150 departing from the terminal exits.

The buses 150 and 42 are used as an express line, also known as “Metrobus”. It takes about 50 minutes to get to the city center by these buses.

Taxi
You can reach the city by taking a taxi from the airport which is 15 kilometers away from the city center. Taking taxi to the city center costs an average taxi fare, but taxi fare is a little bit higher if you want to go Miami Beach and South Beach.

Rent a car
You can get to every point of the city by renting a car from the airport keeping in mind that there is traffic on weekend evenings, especially in Downtown and Miami Beach.

At the airport, there are many car rental offices, some of which offer luxury cars. After renting a car from the airport, you need to drive through the toll road called ‘Airport Expy’. This road will connect you to the 6th Avenue at a major intersection.

Once you cross a big intersection again, you will be connected to the 3rd Avenue. These roads numbered and named based on the 4 main directions will eventually connect you to the city center through the 4th Avenue.

Miami Intl. Airport
Miami is one of the most vibrant cities in the United States. This coastal city is served by 5 airports, including Miami International Airport, which is the main airport in South Florida for long-haul international flights and is a major gateway between Latin America and the U.S. There are a variety of transportation alternatives to get to the city center from the airport, including rail, bus, taxi, and rental cars. 

Rail
Miami International Airport is connected to the city center and other parts of the Greater Miami area by the Metrorail, and Tri-Rail systems. Both systems ensure a comfortable and convenient trip to the city from the airport. The Metrorail system operates from the airport to various locations in Miami. The Metrorail Orange Line runs from the Miami Central Station, which is accessible from the airport terminals using the free MIA Mover train. It takes about 15 minutes to get to Downtown Miami from the Miami Central Station. The Tri-Rail system operates from the airport, via the Miami Central Station, to Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and West Palm Beach. The Tri-Rail System is accessible from the airport terminals using the free MIA Mover train. For more detailed information on these lines and routes please visit Miami Internatoinal Airport’s website.

Bus
The Metrobus system is another convenient and affordable transportation alternative to get to the city center from the airport. The Metrobus also connects to the Metrorail and Metromover. You can take the Metrobus to major locations in the city from the Miami Central Station. The Miami Central Station is accessible using the MIA Mover train from the airport terminals. For more detailed information regarding the Metrobus please visit Miami International Airport’s website.

Taxi
Taxis are a comfortable and easy transportation alternative to get to the city center from the airport. Taxis are easily accessible from the designated taxi stands located at the lower level outside of the terminals. We recommend ignoring transportation offers from solicitors inside the terminals. There are uniformed airport attendants on duty ready to help passengers. A taxi to the city center takes about 20 minutes. For more information about taxi companies and fares please visit Miami International Airport’s website.

Rent A Car
Renting a car from the airport is another method of transportation passengers can consider to get to the city. Renting a car is also a great option for getting around the city and its surrounding areas during your trip. There are various rental car companies located at the Rental Car Center. The Rental Car Center is accessible from the terminals using the MIA Mover train. Rental car companies that you can choose from include Advantage, Alamo, Budget, Enterprise, National, Payless, Sixt, and Hertz.

688,https://www.cipfa.org/cipfa-thinks/articles/provisional-settlement-2025,"Provisional settlement 2025: Progress, transparency, and next steps
Joanne Pitt, Senior Policy Manager

December saw the floodgates open for local government consultations, including the white paper on devolution in addition to consultations on local audit, strengthening standards, funding reform and pensions - all released alongside the 2025-26 local government provisional settlement. And while deadlines vary, the challenge of resourcing responses is concerning. Reaching the right solutions requires sustained and well-informed input, as well as high-quality challenge and debate.

As a veteran of the 2016 Fair Funding Review, I am aware that while consensus around principles is relatively easy, progress slows significantly when delving more deeply. Despite the challenges, progress is essential. Here are my observations on the provisional local government finance settlement 2025-26 consultations.

CIPFA CEO Owen Mapley has welcomed the additional funding, particularly for social care – a critical issue for local authorities - and recognised the need for further reform. We also welcome the consolidation of four grants into the Revenue Support Grant, which simplifies the funding landscape.

Transparency and funding conditions
A key area for improvement lies in transparency. Delays in disclosing the specifics of allocated funding, particularly new funding, complicates budgeting. For instance, the conditions for the Children’s Social Care prevention grant will only be published alongside the final settlement. While additional funding is welcome, uncertainty around accompanying conditions hampers financial planning. Going forward, such conditions should be included in policy statements to enable better financial decision-making.

National insurance concerns
The changes to National Insurance contributions announced in the budget remain a significant concern for local government. Many council employees, particularly within the care sector, fall in this bracket. While the government hinted at compensation, the funding of £515m appears more like a contribution, leaving councils to absorb additional costs.

Compounding the issue, allocations will be based on 2023-24 Revenue Outturn data and published at the final settlement. This delay creates gaps in budget figures, leaving many councils struggling to stretch their funding. CIPFA urges the Ministry for Housng, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) to clarify funding sooner. The fact remains, compensation and contribution are not the same thing. Councils can manage challenges effectively only when the full picture is provided in advance.

IFRS 9 statutory override
My final comment on the provisional settlement revolves around the impact of IFRS 9. CIPFA has consistently maintained that the override on pooled investments should end as soon as possible.

While there are difficulties with removing this statutory override, the sector remains in the same position as that of October 2022. Fair value movements on investments in pooled funds should impact the general fund of local authorities, aligning with high standards in financial reporting that improve financial and risk management.   

If the override is extended, CIPFA and ICAEW recommend a time-limited extension with a defined scope. This approach balances the need for stability with the importance of adhering to sound financial principles.

While the sector has faced worse settlements in the past, the increased funding - especially for vulnerable groups - is welcomed. In addition, the approach to recovery grant allocation, while not outright reform, hints at a direction of travel. CIPFA emphasises that sustained progress requires greater transparency, timely communication of funding conditions, and adherence to high reporting standards. These elements are crucial for ensuring local authorities can manage their finances effectively and continue delivering critical services.","CIPFA

One of the major challenges that any NLP Data Scientist faces is to choose the best possible numerical/vectorial representation of the text strings for running Machine Learning models. In a general scenario, we work on a bunch of text information that may or may not be tagged and we then want to build a ML model that can understand the pattern based on the words present in the strings to predict a new text data.

For example, we know that ""Its raining heavily outside"" and ""Its pouring down outside"" mean the same thing. But how to make the computer understand it. As far as we know, computers can only understand numerical data, while natural language data, for computers, are just text strings without any numerical or statistical information.

Read the original article at my personal blog site:




So how to bridge the gap? How to make computers understand text data?

By converting texts to numbers and also conserving linguistic information for analysis.

Don’t spend another dollar on cybersecurity until you benchmark
By by CyberOwl8 January 2024No Comments
How do you know you need to invest more in cyber securing your ships?

How do you prove it to your management team?

Building a business case for cybersecurity is notoriously difficult.

Risk is hard to quantify. Security doesn’t directly lead to revenue generation or cost cutting. It results in risk reduction. But how much risk is too much risk? And how do you estimate the likelihood when there is limited historical data and cyber risk is continuously evolving?
Standards feel arbitrary. Standards tend to be a long list of actions to complete. If you cannot afford to complete the long list in one go, standards don’t generally support prioritisation. Do it all, or fail to meet the standard. Critically, standards are voluntary unless they become well-enforced regulation.
We looked into why the shipping sector finds it is so difficult to know what and how much to invest in cybersecurity. The findings were covered in a report we developed with HFW and Thetius – “Shifting tides, rising ransoms and critical decisions”.

How are your competitors prioritising?

41% said not having the ability to benchmark cyber hygiene with comparable organisations is a major challenge for securing the right cyber security resources.


As a sector, we shouldn’t be competing on cybersecurity. But some comparison, channelled in the right way, can be healthy.

Imagine if you had a way to understand:

What areas of cybersecurity other shipping companies are investing in.
How much they are investing in these areas, to what level of maturity.
How you compare, how far behind or ahead.
Would this change your priorities?

Would it support your business case?

Would it strengthen the dialogue with your management team?

There are a few ways you can get hold of some benchmarking information:

Develop or join a peer group. Knowledge-sharing networks are strong in shipping. Some of these are informal. Others are more formal organisations likeAMMITEC, theSingapore Shipping Association, the Cyprus Chamber of Shipping or MTS-ISAC in the US. Be prepared that it will take time to build trust before your peers openly share. At CyberOwl, we also maintain a network of c.400 shipping IT professionals. Let us know by replying to this email and we would be glad to put you in touch with your peers.
Get your vendor to work harder. Trials are useful to understand a vendor’s proposition, but can also be valuable to uncover areas of relative weakness. A vendor that knows their space should also be able to provide you a strong steer, based on actual industry adoption, rather than theoretical. The key is to get them to explain why others are investing in certain cybersecurity controls.
CyberOwl has developed a shipping cyber maturity scorecard. We are now piloting this with early adopters. In return for participating as an early adopter, you will gain access to an anonymised benchmark across all participants. Become an early adopter and gain access to the benchmarking data by clicking here to register your interest.

QLIP是什么
QLIP（Quantized Language-Image Pretraining）是英伟达等推出的视觉标记化方法，结合高质量的图像重建和零样本图像理解能力。QLIP二进制球形量化（BSQ）的自编码器进行训练，同时优化重建目标和语言-图像对齐目标。QLIP能作为视觉编码器或图像标记器，无缝集成到多模态模型中，在理解与生成任务中表现出色。QLIP为统一多模态模型的开发提供新的思路。

QLIP
QLIP的主要功能
高质量图像重建：用较低的压缩率重建高质量的图像。
强大的语义理解：支持生成语义丰富的视觉标记，支持零样本图像分类和多模态理解任务。
多模态任务支持：作为视觉编码器或图像标记器，无缝集成到多模态模型中，支持文本到图像生成、图像到文本生成等任务。
统一的多模态模型：支持一个模型同时处理纯文本、图像到文本和文本到图像的任务。
QLIP的技术原理
二进制球形量化（BSQ）：用二进制球形量化（BSQ）技术，将图像编码为离散的视觉标记。BSQ将高维空间中的点映射到单位球面上的二进制角点，实现高效的量化和压缩。
对比学习目标：QLIP引入对比学习目标，基于图像文本对齐的方式，让视觉标记与语言嵌入对齐。QLIP用InfoNCE损失函数，学习将同一图像和文本对的嵌入拉近，将不同对的嵌入推远。对齐机制使视觉标记能重建图像，理解图像的语义内容。
两阶段训练：
第一阶段：优化重建损失、量化损失和对比损失的加权和。目标是学习语义丰富的视觉表示，保持图像的重建质量。
第二阶段：在第一阶段的基础上，进一步优化重建质量，基于微调量化瓶颈和视觉解码器，恢复高频细节。这一阶段会丢弃文本编码器并冻结视觉编码器，避免在大批次训练时的性能退化。
动态平衡损失：基于动态调整对比损失和重建损失的权重，解决两种目标之间的竞争问题。具体方法是根据损失值的倒数调整权重，平衡两种目标的收敛速度。
加速训练与更好的初始化：从预训练的模型（如Masked Image Modeling或CLIP）初始化视觉编码器和文本编码器，显著提高训练效率，减少训练所需的样本数量。

QLIP的应用场景
多模态理解：用在视觉问答（VQA）和图文推理（GQA），帮助模型理解图像生成准确回答。
文本到图像生成：根据文本描述生成高质量图像，细节更符合语义。
图像到文本生成：生成图像描述（caption），提供更准确的文本内容。
统一多模态模型：支持一个模型同时处理文本、图像到文本和文本到图像的任务。

Getting the right patient to the right care in the right time is the fundamental objective of trauma systems improvement efforts. This is most crucial for children, in whom timely access to specialized trauma care provides the greatest opportunity for survival.1 Unfortunately, access to pediatric trauma care is highly variable in the US.2,3 In many circumstances adult or nontrauma facilities are the only hospitals available. For this reason, enhancing the pediatric readiness of emergency departments (ED) at adult trauma centers is now a priority of the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma.4 Newgard et al5 previously showed that treatment at high–pediatric readiness EDs is associated with survival.

An ethics inquiry follows a multi-step process. The time it takes to process an inquiry request varies and depends on a number of factors, including the seriousness of the alleged conduct, the scope and complexity of the file and the priority that the Office of the Syndic must accord to certain files where the risk of compromising public protection is high.

The existence and content of the inquiry file are confidential. All the information collected, including the expert report, forms an integral part of the Syndic’s inquiry file; it cannot be transmitted to the complainant during the course of the inquiry, nor be used to support civil litigation. Should a disciplinary complaint be filed, the information gathered will be transmitted to the dentist in question to enable them to defend themselves and will be presented as evidence before the Disciplinary Council.","Public

Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is a Health Level Seven International® (HL7®) standard for exchanging health care information electronically. The health care community is adopting this next generation exchange framework to advance interoperability. Electronic health records (EHRs) represent patient data in different ways (e.g., medications, encounters) and FHIR provides a means for representing and sharing information among clinicians and organizations in a standard way regardless of the ways local EHRs represent or store the data. FHIR combines the best features of previous standards into a common specification, while being flexible enough to meet the needs of a wide variety of use cases within the health care ecosystem. FHIR focuses on implementation and uses the latest web technologies to aid rapid adoption.

FHIR is composed of foundational, infrastructure, administrative, data exchange, and clinical reasoning modules to support a wide variety of clinical contexts. The Clinical Reasoning Module includes a collection of resources, and operations designed to support the representation, distribution, and evaluation of clinical knowledge artifacts. These artifacts include clinical decision support rules, quality measures, public health indicators, order sets, clinical protocols, and evidence summaries. This module enables use of the same requests for information to improve care at the time of service (clinical decision support) and to evaluate care after it occurs (quality measurement), a vast improvement over previous care improvement standards.

FHIR Quality Measurement
The health care community and CMS are exploring a potential transition to FHIR-based quality measurement beginning with research and testing. Currently used quality standards, Quality Data Model (QDM), Clinical Quality Language (CQL), Health Quality Measure Format (HQMF), and Quality Reporting Document Architecture (QRDA), remain the backbone of electronic clinical quality measure (eCQM) development and reporting. However, the FHIR standard has potential to better align with the EHR's ability to share data in clinical settings, to improve alignment with clinical decision support initiatives, and to reduce overall burden on measure developers and implementers.  

In order to assess the transition to FHIR quality measurement, it is important to understand the components of an eCQM and how the components will evolve with FHIR. As shown in the graphic, an eCQM is composed of three primary parts, the data model, expression logic, and structure.

eCQM structure graphic showing the data model, expression logic, and structure.

Data Model: How to describe the patient’s medical record data needed to calculate the measure
Expression Logic: How to calculate the result and evaluate the performance
Structure: The container and sections describing measure metadata, numerator, denominator, exclusions, exceptions
The left side of the graphic shows the current state and the right side of the graphic shows the potential future state if CMS adopts FHIR for eCQMs.

Graphic shows current eCQM standards and potential new standards

A FHIR eCQM uses the FHIR Quality Measure Implementation Guide and the Quality Improvement Core Framework (QI-Core) Implementation Guide. The goal is to align quality measurement standards for eCQM development and reporting:

Quality Improvement Core Framework (QI-Core) replaces QDM for clinical data. QI-Core is a version-specific data model built directly on top of FHIR resources (US Core and base FHIR resources).
FHIR Quality Measure replaces HQMF for eCQM structure. The Quality Measure IG provides guidance in using the FHIR Measure resource for eCQM structure.
DEQM individual and summary reporting replace QRDA I and QRDA III reporting.
FHIR Resources
Resources are the basis for all exchangeable FHIR content. Each resource includes a standard definition and human-readable descriptions about how to use the resource. Each resource also has a set of common and resource-specific metadata (attributes) to allow its use clearly and unambiguously. FHIR Resources can store and/or exchange many types of clinical and administrative data, which is the foundation for the data model used in quality measurement.

FHIR Profiles and Implementation Guides for Quality Measurement
A profile is a FHIR Resource that has been changed to meet the needs of a specific use case. For example, a measure developer may use the FHIR Observation resource to indicate anything observed about a patient. To indicate vital signs, there is a requirement for a vital signs profile, which provides greater structure by listing specific data (e.g., blood pressure, respiratory rate) along with appropriate coding for the specific data element(s). Using the vital signs profile in EHRs avoids variation and makes data sharing easier.

The FHIR community often assembles multiple easily consumable profiles into implementation guides (IGs). As an example, QI-Core is an IG containing profiles for representing the clinical data in an eCQM.

For the purposes of investigating a transition to FHIR-based quality measurement, CMS is collaborating with HL7 to advance emerging standards and develop additional FHIR profiles for both eCQM development and reporting.

Base Resource	US Core*	Measure Resource	Measure Report

Exchange Specifications
The exchange specification defines how to exchange and manage resources in the form of real-time Representational State Transfer (RESTful) application programming interfaces (APIs) and messaging and documents. RESTful APIs allow for the exchange of FHIR resources using HTTP requests. The exchange specifications provide the foundation for reporting of eCQMs using FHIR.

基金对纺织服装行业持仓比例处于较低水平，24Q3持仓比例环比下降。根据Wind， 从近八年的数据来看，公募基金重仓持股纺织服装行业占比自16Q1起呈现持续下降 的趋势，在17Q3达到最低值0.23%，接着反弹至18Q2的0.77%后又开始下降，20Q3 创新低达0.11%，此后虽有波动，但整体呈现回升趋势，24Q1达到0.48%，24Q2环 比24Q1下降0.09个百分点至0.39%，24Q3环比24Q2下降0.05个百分点至0.34%。 16Q3至今公募基金重仓持股纺织服装行业占比持续低于纺织服装行业占A股总市值 的比例，这一比例在24Q3为0.62%，环比24Q2有所下降，下降0.03个百分点。分拆 纺织制造与服装家纺子板块看，公募基金重仓持股纺织制造板块占比24Q3为0.15%， 环比24Q2上升0.01个百分点；公募基金重仓持股服装家纺板块24Q3为0.19%，环比 24Q2下降0.06个百分点。

基金对港股纺服行业持仓比例仍处于历史低位水平，24Q3环比下降。自17Q1至自 17Q1至23Q2，公募基金重仓和QDII持有的港股纺服市值占其港股持股市值的比重， 均高于SW纺服港股通市值占港股通总市值的比例；23Q3以来公募基金重仓和QDII 持有的港股纺服市值占其港股持股市值的比重持续低于SW纺服港股通市值占港股 通总市值的比例。从趋势上看，公募基金重仓和QDII持有的港股纺服行业占比自 17Q1起呈持续上升趋势，在19Q3达到峰值5.88%，之后逐渐下降，21Q2上升5.43 个百分点至8.92%，达到自17年以来的历史最高位置。自21Q3-24Q3大体呈现波动 下降的趋势，于22Q1降至3.21%，22Q2反弹至4.48%，之后逐渐下降，24Q3环比 24Q2下降0.16pct至0.70%，且低于SW纺服港股通市值占港股通总市值的比例 1.35%。

二、纺织服装行业 2025 年投资策略：六大关键词： 贸易摩擦，第二曲线，品牌复苏，家纺回暖，户外趋 势，市值管理
（一）纺织服装行业 2025 年投资策略

展望2025年，上游纺织制造板块建议关注三条投资主线：（1）参考上一轮贸易摩擦 经验，虽然美国总统选举结果在未来短期可能对板块内相关龙头公司业绩或者估值 构成扰动，但预计影响不大，从长期看，相关龙头公司行业进入门槛高，竞争力强， 下游客户质量优秀，有望保持稳健增长。（2）建议关注在外部逆全球化，内部国家 鼓励新质生产力的背景下，积极探索新赛道新产品打造第二增长曲线的纺织制造板 块龙头公司。（3）伴随市值管理正式稿发布，主要指数数成份股公司应当制定上市 公司市值管理制度， 长期破净公司应当制定上市公司估值提升计划，利好板块内相 关上市公司。此外，今年以来国家出台多个文件鼓励上市公司高质量并购重组，并 购重组也是市值管理的重要方式之一，看好板块内未来相应的投资机会。

（二）关键词一：贸易摩擦

展望2025年，特朗普赢得本届美国大选，其在本轮竞选中对我国提出了较为激进的 关税主张，复盘上轮特朗普任期内贸易摩擦，我们认为：（1）本轮纺织服装行业关 税实际加征额有望低于其竞选期的表态；（2）除少数公司外，加征关税对各公司扣 非归母净利润影响有限，主要系相关公司积极布局海外产能，以及和优质客户深度 绑定，共担关税成本等因素；（3）加征关税动作短期内可能对相关公司股价产生负 面影响，后续股价有望较快修复。 根据央视新闻网，2024年11月6日美国共和党总统候选人、前总统特朗普宣布在2024 年总统选举中获胜。根据广发策略2024年11月报告《美国大选靴子落地，A股将如 何演绎？》，特朗普在本轮竞选中对我国提出了较为激进的关税主张。本节通过复 盘上轮贸易摩擦对我国纺织服装行业影响，分析特朗普当选预期下对纺织服装行业 的未来影响。

复盘特朗普上一轮任期内对我国多轮加征关税过程，纺织服装行业关税实际加征额 低于竞选口号，本轮纺织服装行业关税实际加征额有望低于其竞选期的表态。根据 商务部官网，2016 年 8 月，特朗普表示若赢得大选，将对中国商品征收 45%的惩 罚性关税。根据路透社报道，特朗普任期内对中国商品最终加征税率在 7.5%-25% 之间。 2017 年 8 月美国贸易代表公室发起对华 301 调查，此后，美国发布 4 批清单对中 国商品进行关税加收。2018 年 7 月 6 日，美国对贸易总值约 340 亿美元的中国商 品加征 25%的关税（清单 1），8 月 23 日对约 160 亿商品加征 25%的关税（清单 2），这两份清单中不涉及纺织服装相关品类。随着中美关系的急剧恶化，9 月 24 日美国对贸易总值 2000 亿美元的中国商品加征 10%关税。其中，纺织类商品贸易 总值超过 40 亿，涉及湿巾、塑料、橡胶、皮革、毛皮制服装及附件、蚕丝、毛、 棉、植物纤维、化学纤维等纺织类产品，并于 2019 年 5 月将这批商品的关税提高 至 25%。2019 年 8 月 30 日，USTR 公布对华约 3000 亿美元商品加征 15%关税 清单，其中，清单 4A 于 2019 年 9 月 1 日生效，服装家纺类产品超过 310 亿美 元，涉及了大部分成衣、床上用品、家居用品、野营用品及运动鞋服。2020 年 2 月 14 日起清单 4A 涉及商品税率降低至 7.5%。清单 4B 于 2019 年 12 月 18 日宣 布暂不生效。与此同时，美国对小部分中国商品免除 301 关税并允许申请延长豁免 期限。2000 亿（美元）清单里纺服类产品受豁免共 985 项，22 项产品豁免延期至 2020 年 12 月 31 日，27 项产品豁免延期至 2020 年 8 月 7 日。3000 亿清单中纺 服类产品受豁免共 939 项，2 项产品豁免延期至 2020 年 12 月 31 日，23 项产品豁免延期至 2020 年 9 月 1 日，此后进一步延期至 2024 年 5 月 31 日，根据《工商 时报》报道，部分商品豁免权期限已经延长至 2025 年 5 月 31 日。 从上轮特朗普加关税时对各公司产品的征收情况来看，2018 年清单 1、2 不涉及纺 织服装品类，清单 3、4 几乎覆盖全部纺织服装品类，公司从中国出口至美国的产 品多数被征收 7.5%或 25%的关税。

此处选取部分出口占比较高的A股/港股纺织制造龙头公司为样本，比较2018、2019 年的净利润变动和估值变动；前者主要考虑到关税提升，出口竞争力下降，需求减 少影响收入或者下游客户转嫁关税成本压价影响毛利率，最终都会体现在企业归母 净利润上，后者主要考虑市场情绪受加征关税的影响： 除少数公司外，加征关税对各公司扣非归母净利润影响有限，主要系相关公司积极 布局海外产能，以及和优质客户深度绑定，共担关税成本等因素。复盘上轮贸易摩 擦，从扣非归母净利润看，2018年，除华利集团（同比-50.0%，2017-18年华利集团 扣非归母净利润较低，主要系公司后续进行同一控制下的重组，被重组方损益重组 前计入非经常性损益）、百隆东方（同比-2.1%，主要系受中美贸易摩擦、越南工厂 产能增加等因素综合影响，公司产品2018年在中国境内销量同比下降，在境外销量 同比上升，主营业务相关的收入和利润较上期小幅增长，但投资收益同比下降较多， 进而导致扣非归母净利润整体小幅下降）、裕元集团（同比-32.7%，主要系全球经 济增速放缓，消费承压，及中美贸易摩擦影响），其他样本公司均实现同比增长，健 盛集团同比+94.6%（主要系棉袜国内产能改造基本完成，越南产能释放，以及俏尔 婷婷并表），孚日股份同比+4.0%（主要系公司家纺主业稳健增长，和优质客户深度 绑定，共担关税成本），鲁泰A同比+3.1%（维持稳健增长），联发股份同比+43.3% （主要系2018年人民币贬值背景下毛利率提升，以及汇兑收益增加促财务费用同比 减少），盛泰集团同比+32.5%（2018年未上市），申洲国际同比+22.9%（主要系海 外产能大幅上升，资源消耗水平有效降低），晶苑国际同比+0.7%（维持稳健增长）； 2019年，除孚日股份（同比-31.4%，主要系主业以外的房地产业务等收入下降，以 及2019.4- 2020.4 人民币兑美元升值造成汇兑损失），以及鲁泰A（同比-17.8%）、 联发股份（同比-7.8%）、百隆东方（同比-37.4%）、裕元集团（同比-15.2%），受 全球经济增速放缓，消费承压，及中美贸易摩擦影响造成扣非归母净利润同比下降 外，其他样本公司均实现同比增长，华利集团同比+174800.0%（主要系公司重组， 被重组方损益重组前计入非经常性损益），健盛集团同比+27.1%（主要系海外产能 加速扩张，运动类客户占比提升），盛泰集团同比+128.2%（2019年未上市），申 洲国际同比+12.2%（主要系海外产能放量），晶苑国际同比+2.0%（维持稳健增长）。 整体来看，积极布局海外产能，和优质客户深度绑定，共担关税成本等因素均对相 关公司业绩产生正面影响。

加征关税动作短期内可能对相关公司股价产生负面影响，后续股价有望较快修复。 复盘上轮贸易摩擦，从股价端来看，特朗普加关税的几轮动作均造成各公司股价下 跌，短期内对样本公司股价产生影响，但影响持续时间不长，后续样本公司股价多 较快修复。","

Moteurs des véhicules en stationnement : quelles mesures contre les nuisances sonores et olfactives ?

Une question écrite, n° 01152, a été posée au ministre d’État et ministre de la Transition écologique et Solidaire afin de savoir quels moyens peuvent être mis en place face aux nuisances sonores et à la pollution de l’air occasionnées par les moteurs des véhicules en stationnement. Le ministère de la Transition écologique et Solidaire a répondu le 5 octobre 2017 alléguant que les véhicules faisaient l’objet d’un contrôle technique poussé permettant de garantir leur conformité aux normes antipollution. Ce contrôle technique devra notamment être renforcé dès janvier 2019. Il évoque également la multiplication des équipements de coupure automatique du moteur à l’arrêt. Le gouvernement a enfin rappelé l’objectif d’éradiquer les véhicules émetteurs de gaz à effet de serre d’ici 2040.

Immatriculation

Depuis 6 novembre 2017, toutes les démarches de certificat d’immatriculation se font en ligne et non plus aux guichets des préfectures. Deux arrêtés du 29 septembre 2017 et du 13 octobre 2017 viennent préciser ce système de télé services. L’arrêté du 13 octobre 2017 portant information du public sur la dématérialisation des démarches administratives relatives aux certificats d’immatriculation, modifiant l’arrêté du 9 février 2009 relatif aux modalités d’immatriculation des véhicules prévoit que toute demande d’immatriculation d’un véhicule neuf ou d’occasion est adressée au ministre de l’Intérieur soit par voie électronique, soit par l’intermédiaire d’un professionnel de l’automobile habilité par le ministre de l’Intérieur. Cette dématérialisation a déjà été mise en place dans certains départements depuis le 2 octobre 2017 (Val-de-Marne, Côte-d’Or, Jura…).

Introducing Plotly Cloud — The easiest way to publish your Dash apps. Learn more.

 Column Definitions
Define columns on the AgGrid component using the columnDefs property, provided as a list of dictionaries. Columns render in the order they are provided.

See AG Grid documentation Column Properties for a list of all properties that can be applied to a column.

Here, we define a grid with 3 columns:

columnDefs = [
    {'field': 'Name'},
    {'field': 'PetalLength'},
    {'field': 'PetalWidth'},
]
Use defaultColDef to set properties that all columns will inherit. Adding to the previous example, here we configure all columns to be editable:

columnDefs = [
    {'field': 'Name'},
    {'field': 'PetalLength'},
    {'field': 'PetalWidth'},
],
defaultColDef = {'editable': True}
And here, we make all columns editable, except the Name column:

columnDefs = [
    {'field': 'Name', 'editable': False},
    {'field': 'PetalLength'},
    {'field': 'PetalWidth'},
],
defaultColDef = {'editable': True}
The previous example makes all columns editable, except the Name column, because when the grid creates a column, it starts with the default column definition. It then adds properties defined via column types (see the next section) and then finally adds properties from the specific column definition.

Basic Column Definitions
Here's a complete example using ColumnDefs and defaultColDef. In this example, all columns are sortable, except for the Name column, which has sortable set to False.

App
Code
Grouping Columns
If you want the columns to be grouped, you can include them as children like so:

# put the three columns into a group
columnDefs = [
    {
        'headerName': 'Sepal',
        'children': [
            {'field': ""SepalWidth"", 'headerName': 'Width'},
            {'field': ""SepalLength"", 'headerName': 'Length'},
        ]
    },
]
Here is an example using columns grouping:

App
Code
Groups are explained in more detail in the section Column Groups.

Accessing Nested Data Values
The field property is used to access values from the row data. In most cases the field will be a property name. If, however, the row data contains nested dictionaries, you can use dot notation to reference deep property values.

For example, if the row data has a dictionary property Sepal that contains the Width and Length of the Sepal, then use the field values Sepal.Width and Sepal.Length to display the Width and Length.

rowData = [
    {
        'Name': 'Iris-setosa',
        'Sepal': {
            'Width': 3.5,
            'Length': 5.1
        },
        'Petal': {
            'Width': 0.2,
            'Length': 1.4
        },
    },
]

columnDefs = [
    {""field"": ""Name""},
    # Uses dot notation to access nested properties
    {""field"": ""Sepal.Width""},
    {""field"": ""Sepal.Length""},
    {""field"": ""Petal.Width""},
    {""field"": ""Petal.Length""},

Today’s Trail Running Checklist blog is brought to you by our partners at the Potomac River Running Company! To learn more and schedule an appointment, check out their website at potomacriverrunning.com

Ready to get outdoors and take to the trail? Make the most of your day and your adventure with these must-have items. Included on this checklist, you will find some of our top products and footwear for the great outdoors.

– Trail Shoes. Check out our selection of men’s and women’s trail shoes. Be sure to consider shoes that are also waterproof or water-resistant to keep your feet dry.

– Performance Socks. Cotton socks are not an option when it comes to trail running and walking! Consider getting a pair of moisture-wicking performance socks. Also, try out a taller sock length to cover your ankles and calves. This will decrease any dirt and mud splatters and will also help keep the ticks off you!

– Moisture Wicking Apparel. Stay dry with moisture-wicking clothing. Depending on the season, you may want to invest in additional layers so you’ll be prepared for cool mornings and warm afternoons.  Also, consider how much sun exposure you will have on the trail. For trails that are more open make sure you are covered and use sunscreen. Additional coverage is also a good idea for areas that are highly populated with ticks.

– Cap, Hat, or Buff. Keep your head covered and avoid overexposure of the sun as you navigate the trail. We love the Sprints hats! The fun colorful patterns make them the perfect addition to your running wardrobe. Buy one, or collect them all!

– Hydration Vest, Pack, or Handheld. Make sure to pack enough water for the amount of time you will be out and about. When deciding how much water to pack, be sure to consider the temperature and how many hours you will be outside.

– Bug Spray and Sunscreen. These two items can go a long way when you are on the trail. Don’t forget to reapply for longer days outdoors.

– Road IDs or Safety Bracelet. A great way to stay safe is to wear an item that includes your name and a contact person in case of an emergency. In addition, you can include this information in a pack or vest if you plan to wear one.

– Gaiters. For days that are muddy or trails that include a lot of rocks and debris, consider wearing gaiters.

– Nutrition. Don’t forget snacks! Pick from a wide variety of gels, chews, or drink powders to keep you energized all day out on the trail.

– Run Laces. Don’t let untied shoes slow you down or trip you up on the trail. Instead, try a pair of elastic lock Run Laces.

– Garmin GPS Watch. A GPS will help you stay on track and record your mileage.

– Body Glide. Apply Body Glide before heading out on the trail to prevent chafing and blisters.

– Safety & Reflective Products. Depending on the time of day or amount of time you plan to be on the trail, you may want to carry a light or wear a headlamp. In addition, safety items such as a whistle are great to take on less traveled trails. Be sure to always share your location and length of time traveling with a loved one or friend.

Before you head out for your next adventure, stop by one of our Trail Centers at =PR= Leesburg, One Loudoun, Reston, Springfield, South Riding or shop online to get all of the items you need.

Now that you have all the gear, it’s time to hit the trail running and enjoy the great outdoors. Tag @jacksonclinics on social media to share with us your trail adventures!

Das Weinanbaugebiet Ahr
Ein Paradies für den Spätburgunder
 
Weinberge, die sich der Sonne entgegenstrecken, warme Schieferböden und ein fast mediterranes Klima machen das Ahrtal zu einem Paradies für den Weinanbau. König der Rebsorten ist hier der Spätburgunder! Ahrweine gehören jedes Jahr zu den Top-Weinen Deutschlands und sorgen mit ihrem samtig-fruchtigen und von Schieferböden geprägtem Geschmack für Aufsehen in der Weinfachwelt.

Schau doch mal bei unseren Winzern vorbei, probiere die Vielfalt der Ahrweine und lassen dich in den gemütlichen Straußwirtschaften und Weinstuben verwöhnen.

   Der Ahrwein-Check
Die Ahr ist das größte zusammenhängende Rotweinanbaugebiet Deutschlands mit über 80 Prozent roten Rebsorten.
 
Die kleinste Weinbergslage Deutschlands gibt es im Weinort Walporzheim: Die ""Gärkammer"" umfasst nur 0,7 Hektar Fläche, zählt aber zu den Spitzenlagen der Ahr.
 
Die älteste eingetragene Winzergenossenschaft der Welt ist an der Ahr zu Hause: 1868 gegründet, zählt die Winzergenossenschaft Mayschoß-Altenahr zu den besten in Deutschland.
 
Drei der schönsten ""Weinsichten"" Deutschlands liegen im Ahrtal: die faszinierenden Panoramaausblicke am Altenahrer Eck, am Dernauer Sonderberg und auf der Mayschosser Burgruine Saffenburg.
 
Königliche Auszeichnung: Als Deutsche Weinkönigin 2020/2021 war Eva Lanzerath von der Ahr internationale Botschafterin der 13 deutschen Weinanbaugebiete.

Ahrwein des Jahres – Die Galanacht der Spitzenweine

Am 7. November werden die besten Ahrweine 2025 im Rahmen einer glanzvollen Gala im Steigenberger Kurhaus Bad Neuenahr gekürt – begleitet von einem exklusiven 4-Gang-Menü, einer musikalischen Live-Show vom Musical-Star Deborah Sasson, der Moderation von Stefan Mross und einer mitreißenden After-Show-Party. Ein Abend voller Genuss, Emotion und regionaler Spitzenklasse!

Qualität aus Leidenschaft

Die Ahr ist ein Rotwein-Land, in dem der Spätburgunder regiert. Rund 65 Prozent der rund 500 Hektar Rebfläche gehören ihm. Insbesondere an den steilen Weinbergterrassen im engen Tal fühlt er sich wohl. Handarbeit ist hier das Stichwort. Der Einsatz von Maschinen ist kaum möglich, alle Trauben werden von Hand gelesen. Qualität statt Quantität ist daher an der Ahr die Maxime.

Im Ahrtal wachsen einige der besten Spätburgunder Deutschlands und das hat seinen Grund: Hier gedeihen die Reben auf Schieferböden - verbunden mit einem fast mediterranen Mikroklima - im gesamten Tal. Beste Voraussetzungen für die Winzer, mit großer Leidenschaft und höchster Fachkompetenz aus den Trauben ausdrucksstarke Spitzenweine von einzigartiger Struktur, Eleganz und Fruchtfülle kreieren.

 



Kein Wunder also, dass jährlich zahlreiche Prämierungen und Auszeichnungen an die Ahr gehen. Und noch eine Spezialität ist an der Ahr beheimatet: der eher seltene Blaue Frühburgunder, der für seinen fruchtigen Charakter und seine intensive rote Farbe bekannt ist.
 

Weißer Wein aus roten Trauben
Die Ahr ist mit rund 80 Prozent roten Rebsorten sogar das größte geschlossene Rotweinanbaugebiet Deutschlands. Doch was ist mit den Weißweinen? Neben exzellenten Rieslingen und Weißburgundern hat sich die Ahr ein anderes neues Markenzeichen gegeben: den Blanc de Noir, einen weiß gekelterten Spätburgunder.


So funktioniert die Weinlese
Hast du dich schon mal gefragt, wie eigentlich eine Weinlese abläuft? In unserem Blog-Beitrag erzählen wir dir Wissenswertes über den Höhepunkt des Winzerjahres. Wir erklären dir, was es bei der Weinlese zu beachten gibt und welche Bedeutung sie für eine Weinanbauregion wie das Ahrtal hat.

A new book reverses the narrative of the Age of Discovery, which has long evoked the ambitions of Europeans looking to the Americas rather than vice versa

In 2006, Elizabeth II finally responded to a complaint originally aimed at her 18th-century ancestor George II.



Welcoming a delegation from the Mohegan Tribe, the British queen accepted a petition originally brought to England in 1735 by Sachem Mahomet Weyonomon, who wanted the crown to acknowledge the crisis posed by British settlement of tribal lands in what is now Connecticut. Weyonomon contracted smallpox and died before he could present his petition to a royally appointed commission; as a foreigner, he was barred from being buried in London and was interred outside of the city.

Almost two centuries later, Elizabeth fulfilled a request from the modern-day Mohegan to erect a monument in Weyonomon’s memory. Crafted from Connecticut pink granite, the sculpture was installed on the grounds of Southwark Cathedral, near his unmarked grave, on November 22, 2006. The queen presided over the dedication ceremony, accepting a copy of the original petition and a red stone peace pipe from the delegation.

Weyonomon’s story, in which a Native American leader journeys east to Europe, runs counter to common assumptions about Indigenous people and colonization. The “Age of Discovery,” as the century between the mid-1400s and mid-1500s is commonly known, has long evoked the ambitions of Europeans looking west to the Americas rather than vice versa.


Christopher Columbus is the default example, an Italian who famously “sailed the ocean blue” in 1492, on the first of four major voyages for the Spanish crown. Beyond Columbus, “explorers” who introduced the possibilities of American riches, lands and people to their royal patrons (and eventually the wider world) included Spain’s Hernán Cortés, Portugal’s Vasco da Gama, England’s Sir Walter Raleigh and France’s Jacques Cartier. Despite efforts to change the public’s understanding of this era of exploration—celebrating Indigenous Peoples’ Day instead of Columbus Day, for example, helps shed light on the destructive legacy of colonization—the basic European-dominated narrative has proved difficult to dislodge.

In her new book, On Savage Shores: How Indigenous Americans Discovered Europe, Caroline Dodds Pennock reverses this oft-repeated narrative, demonstrating that Weyonomon’s trip to England was part of a lengthy history of Indigenous people crossing the Atlantic. A historian at the University of Sheffield in England, Pennock explains that tens of thousands of Indigenous people traveled to Europe after 1492, whether as diplomats and leaders, enslaved laborers, or the wives and children of European men.

On Savage Shores: How Indigenous Americans Discovered Europe
A landmark work of narrative history that shatters our previous Eurocentric understanding of the Age of Discovery by telling the story of the Indigenous Americans who journeyed across the Atlantic to Europe after 1492

Cortés’ son Martín, for example, was born in Mexico City in 1522. The child of an Indigenous woman known as La Malinche, he traveled to Spain as a toddler and was raised as a Spanish nobleman. During his illustrious military career, this “Indigenous knight,” as Pennock calls him, even returned briefly to Mexico to meet his mother’s family.

Martín’s experience in Europe was far from typical. Most Indigenous Americans who traveled to the continent were enslaved, and many died from smallpox or other diseases. Still, their stories show just how much historians have missed by assuming that Europeans were the only ones who crossed the Atlantic to see new worlds. Indigenous people’s voyages, says Pennock, “speak to a bigger story that is incredibly relevant right now, about the origins of our world as an entangled, cosmopolitan place.”

Smithsonian chatted with Pennock to learn more about her research and its implications. Read a condensed and edited version of the conversation below.


On Savage Shores dramatically inverts the narrative of the Age of Discovery. Why is this reframing significant to scholars’ understanding of the era?

My story starts with a period people think they know really well, with the Tudors and Golden Age Spain. What most people don’t know is that a Brazilian king, as he’s called in the sources, was at the court of Henry VIII. I was speaking to a Tudor specialist recently, Suzannah Lipscomb, on her podcast, and even she said she didn’t know.

It’s so important to recognize that Indigenous people were in Europe, that it’s not just white people going out from Europe. Indigenous people were experiencing Europe themselves. They were involved in diplomacy, trade and slavery, and they are central to this story. Scholars like Olivette Otele, David Olusoga, Imtiaz Habib and many others have started to shift the view of Europe to include Black people and people of African descent in that story, but Indigenous people haven’t yet been fully incorporated into it.

Coll Thrush wrote a wonderful book, Indigenous London, that covers Indigenous people from the 16th century up to the 20th century and includes Aboriginal people from all across the world. But the reality is that there were thousands of Indigenous people in Europe before the British got heavily involved in North America in the 1580s. My book goes up to the founding of Jamestown in 1607. It was really important for me to focus on the early period where we see the beginnings of globalization. You could carry on telling this story later, but it’s this first period that hasn’t been as well studied.

That’s what the book is about: shedding light on these stories of Indigenous travelers, which are so important in their own right, but also trying to shift that broader picture to give us a sense that their lives matter for how we see this period.

Your book doesn’t address the experiences of Matoaka, the woman referred to as Pocahontas and later Rebecca Rolfe, who was one of the most famous Native Americans to visit Europe. Why not?

First, she’s later than the period of the book. This young Powhatan woman died in England in 1617, before her 22nd birthday, and is buried at Gravesend not far from where I grew up.

Here are 10 different tools that can boost sales on your Shopify store. We hope this is helpful as you build out your ecommerce marketing stack.

Last Updated: May 29, 2025

By Lifesight Editorial

must have shopify marketing apps 3cac56edba 1 - Lifesight
Shopify marketing apps for an online store can help with tasks such as email marketing, social media marketing, advertising and much more. These apps can automate and streamline marketing efforts, allowing store owners to reach a larger audience and increase sales.

Additionally, Shopify marketing apps can provide valuable insights and analytics to help store owners better understand their customers and improve their marketing strategies.

In this article, we’ll go through 10 different tools that can boost sales on your Shopify store. We hope this is helpful as you build out your ecommerce marketing stack.

1) Email and SMS marketing – Lifesight Engage
email and sms marketing tool lifesight engage 116e0a9901 - Lifesight

Email and SMS are the most critical parts of any marketing campaign, whether you’re running a small online store or a multimillion-dollar D2C brand. Both these marketing channels are necessary at every point of the customer journey, from attracting and engaging to retaining customers.

With the help of a customer data and engagement platform like Lifesight, ecommerce brands can easily automate flow messages at every customer touchpoint.

Lifesight also offers customer segmentation based on their behavior that can be used to send hyper-personalized messages. It also offers enterprise-level data capabilities for SMBs and has an analytics layer on top.

Looking for eco-friendly, hand-roasted, stone-ground peanut butter? That’s what you get when you buy it from Zvatra.

They aim to use native, healthy foods as a way to bridge the gap between our modern time schedules and our nutritional needs. Also, it’s worth mentioning that their peanut butter is an all-natural spread.

2) Landing page builder – Unbounce

If you want to make sure your landing page designs and copies are optimized then getting a landing page builder tool is the right approach. It allows you to try out several versions of your offer, as well as variations on your headline and body copy, to see which ones result in higher conversion rates.

With Shopify marketing apps like Unbounce, ecommerce brands can get more out of every click. Because it enables marketers to create and optimize landing pages that are focused on a single purpose rather than letting users to roam around a site full of distractions.

Who is using Unbounce? Three Ships

Source –Three Ships

All of Three Ships skin care products are manufactured with cruelty-free, all-natural ingredients. They aim at keeping all their products under $40 USD permanently, and none are released to customers unless they have been proven effective by scientific studies.

3) Payments – Afterpay

Source – Afterpay

Chargeback and fraudulent transactions are less likely to occur when you use a payment gateway for your online store. They offer numerous advantages to customers, including convenience, speed, security, adaptability, and simplicity.

Online retailers that offer Afterpay get paid immediately. It’s like a modern-day credit card with an interest-free period. Also, their “buy-now-pay-later” platform allows customers to pay for their purchases over four, fortnightly installments.

Every generation in the workforce complains about the last. In many ways, the generational war at work is a final frontier in diversity and inclusion because it seems to make millennials more of a punchline than a problem: “Those millennials are ruining it! They expect a trophy or a gold ribbon for everything they do!”

While it is true that millennials in general do need immediate and regular affirmation, and expect to move up as soon as they master their current job, the big “duh!” moment comes when you consider it isn’t trophies and ribbons they need. It’s red hearts, gold coins, and treasure chests.

That’s right: We need to look to video games to understand millennial motivation. Moreover, this video game mindset has given millennials a distinct advantage in the workforce — one we can all look to make part of our own games!

Millennials entered the workforce from the golden age of gaming. Nintendo, Playstation, and Xbox weaned them, and as a result, they have a distinct perspective about the workforce and their place in it. More than any generation currently at work, millennials passionately care about the work they do and the companies they work for. That is a fact to remember and a quality to actively seek.

But to attract millennials, you have to speak their language — or rather, play their game.

While studies show that children’s brains are 90-95 percent of adult size by age six, the most intense brain development happens during the teenage years. Although I am no millennial, I can tell you that my teenage years were spent playing a lot of video games. The same goes for the majority of millennials, so it should be no surprise that the millennial mindset has embraced the concept of frequent rewards (hearts, coins, power-ups) along the way.

Leveling Up

Role-playing games are some of the most popular among millennials. In these games, you build a character, go out on adventures, earn experience, and when you pass a certain threshold of experience, your character “levels up,” gaining new skills, abilities, and powers — including, in many cases, the ability to use cooler armor and weapons!

Professional development is really not that different from a role-playing game. We know that millennials ask for development early and often, and after getting coaching and training, they follow up and ask how far they are from a promotion. In a video game, you can always see exactly how far into each level you are and how much experience you need to get there.

Why on earth should we fault millenials for asking for this development and promotion when they are crystal clear they intend to work for it?

They do expect clear conversation and feedback so they can see their experience bars. Isn’t that the best kind of coaching relationship a manager could ask for: Someone who is asking, “How do I get better?” and then tracking themselves against the criteria set forth by the answer?

Managing the Game

So, what does the widespread gaming mindset mean for managers? It means we need to be much better at providing ongoing, consistent, and direct feedback. The worst games are those that offer unclear or confusing progression. The same can be said for development conversations. If you are managing a software engineer who has expressed interest in being a senior software engineer, you should know the expectations for the senior role, and you should be able to articulate to your employee how to get there.

Being able to collaborate cross-functionally with product leads? Twenty experience points.

Being able to lead a technical project while driving for results with all collaborators? Twenty-five experience points.

One lesson gamers learn from especially challenging games (I am looking at you, Hollow Knight!) is that you need to play a lot in order to master your skills. After a while of falling on spikes, getting rammed by a rhino-like bug, and falling to your death because your jumping skills need work, you get ever-so-slightly better. Soon, you can bypass all the rhino-bugs and fly over those spikes with ease. Plus, you have honed your reflexes to master the spin jump. What happens then? You unlock the secret door with — wait for it — more challenging skills to develop!

This formula has engaged a generation of gamers, and with the right mindset, it can give you an edge at managing your team and unlocking their abilities.

Power-Ups Along the Way

Game developers have been tossing us power-ups for years — those mushrooms in Super Mario Bros. that increase your size, speed, and strength; coins and hearts that add extra life, health, and stamina. What power-ups have you provided to your employees to improve their leveling experience?","

Chase Freedom Unlimited® Now Has 2 Signup Bonus Options

Links may pay us a commission. We appreciate your support! View our advertiser and editorial disclosure here. The content on this page is accurate as of the posting date; however, some of the offers mentioned may have expired.

Update: DEAD! Don’t miss it if this becomes alive again. Sign up for deal notification alerts here!

Update: The 3x offer is now dead.

Chase Freedom Unlimited® is part of my Chase Quadfecta that will be even more useful after the Starwood AMEX gets downgraded on 8/1 from earning 3 Marriott points per dollar to 2 Marriott points per dollar.

Read the Chase Quadfecta post to learn all about the cards mentioned below in this post.

The standard Chase Freedom Unlimited® offer is now 15k points 17.5K points ($175 given in the form of more valuable Chase Ultimate Rewards points) after spending $500 in 3 months and adding a free additional user card.

Another Chase Freedom Unlimited® offer now available has no signup bonus, but allows you to earn 3 points per dollar on everything for 1 year and 2.5K points for adding a free additional user card. You can’t convert from other cards to get this offer.

Freedom Unlimited normally earns 1.5 Chase Ultimate Rewards points per dollar on everything.

Which offer should you signup for?

That depends on how much you’ll spend. You’ll need to spend more than $10,000 in non-bonus everyday spending during your first year for the 3 points per dollar card to be more valuable than the regular signup offer.

However it will also depend on what other cards you have. Chase allows you to convert between Sapphire, Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card, Sapphire Reserve, Freedom, and Freedom Unlimited as often as you want.

Note that all of those cards are subject to Chase 5/24. 

A post comparing the Sapphire cards can be found here.

Either of those cards can be converted to a Freedom or Freedom Unlimited down the line. My Freedom and Freedom Unlimited cards all were opened as Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card s. Plus, whenever possible I try using cards like Chase Freedom and Ink Business Cash® Credit Card to earn 5 points per dollar on bonus spending categories for everything from gift cards for Amazon from office supply stores, to Visa/Mastercard gift cards on sale from office supply stores, to gas stations and grocery stores on Freedom during bonus quarters.","News

Subaru to stop assembling vehicles in ASEAN from 2025
By
Chips Yap
31/05/2024

New Subaru vehicles sold by TC Subaru Sdn. Bhd. (TCS), the exclusive distributor of Subaru vehicles and after-sales services in Malaysia, will no longer originate from Malaysia or Thailand from 2025. According to a recent announcement by Tan Chong International Limited (TCIL), the CKD or local assembly business model will be phased out.

“Together, TCIL and Subaru Corporation recognize the need for a forward-looking, future-proof approach to adapt to emerging market dynamics. After careful consideration, TCIL and Subaru Corporation have jointly decided to undergo a proactive business transformation by phasing out the existing Completely Knocked-Down (CKD) business model, which is believed to be no longer sustainable in the long term. From next year, the CKD markets in Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Cambodia will transition to a Complete Built-Up (CBU) sales model from Japan,” the announcement explained.


From 2025, the Forester and XV sold in Malaysia and neighbouring countries in ASEAN will originate from Japanese factories.
TCIL also stressed that its business relationship with the Japanese automaker remains strong ‘as TCIL and Subaru Corporation continue to remain agile and explore additional viable business avenues together in Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia’.

“TCIL and Subaru Corporation are confident that this strategic decision will position Subaru for continued success in these dynamic markets. As TCIL embarks on this new chapter together with Subaru Corporation, both TCIL and Subaru Corporation remain steadfast in their commitment to delivering exceptional value to customers, partners, and stakeholders,” the announcement concluded.

No more duty-free benefit
The switch back to CBU models will mean that the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) benefits given to models assembled in ASEAN – ie duty-free import by member nations – will no longer be available. This would mean an increase in prices as CBU models are subject to high import duties.

This new development will have no effect on current owners of Subaru vehicles in Malaysia as TCS reaffirms its commitment to providing comprehensive support and services, with the expertise of Subaru-certified technicians and genuine parts found at its many authorized service centres nationwide.

The assembly of Subaru vehicles in Malaysia goes back longer than many may realise. The first model was assembled in the early 1980s when Wearne Brothers handled the franchise. Wearnes had an affiliated assembly plant, Associated Motor Industries in Selangor, and decided to put a couple of variants of the Leone into local production.


The 1600 GLF (Leone series) was the first Subaru model assembled in Malaysia at the AMI plant in Shah Alam, Selangor. It cost around RM18,000 in 1980.
After Wearnes ended its association with the brand, Federal Auto took over the brand for a while. Then Auto Dunia took over Subaru in the mid-1980s and selected a few models to be assembled locally. The most popular were the 1.8 Stationwagon and the E10, a small rear-engined van which sold well and was a familiar sight as a TNB service vehicle. The stationwagon was popular as it had 4WD, a core selling point for the brand but a rare feature at the time.


Two of the locally-assembled models sold by Auto Dunia during the 1990s.
Auto Dunia stopped handling the Subaru brand after 2002 and it was taken over by the Motor Image Group, a subsidiary of TCIL which held the franchise for the brand in Taiwan and many Southeast Asian markets. For the Malaysian market, TCS has been the Motor Image subsidiary which manages the franchise.


Assembly of the XV at Tan Chong Motor Assemblies began in 2012 (above) and was followed 4 years later by the 4th generation of the Forester.


In 2012, local assembly of the XV crossover began at Tan Chong Motor Assemblies in Kuala Lumpur. Incidentally, this was also the same plant which had assembled the Subaru vehicles for Auto Dunia in the 1990s. Four years after starting local assembly of the XV, the Forester (4th generation) was added as a second model at the plant with the aim of producing 10,000 units annually.","MotaAuto.com

Study Finds Adolescents Spend Nearly 1/4 of School Day on Smartphones
February 3, 20253 min read
Hale lauren
Lauren Hale
New York Governor Hochul recently released a report, “More Learning, Less Scrolling,” to prohibit smartphone use during the school day. A team of public health and pediatric researchers, led by Lauren Hale of Stony Brook University, are working to understand not just screen time use by adolescents but the duration and content of that use, particularly during school.

In a new study that monitored smartphone data, they found that adolescents (aged 13 to 18) spent an average of 1.5 hours each school day on their smartphones. Their findings are highlighted in the JAMA Pediatrics research letter, “Adolescent Smartphone Use During School Hours,” published February 3.

“Unfortunately, too much of the existing research on digital media use relies upon self-reported data. In this study, we were able to objectively assess smartphone use, enabling a much more granular understanding of timing and content of smartphone use,” explained Hale, senior author of the letter and professor in the Program in Public Health and in the Department of Family, Population and Preventive Medicine in the Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University.

“As a public health researcher and a mother of two middle schoolers, I am concerned that too many kids are missing out on both learning and in-person social opportunities during the school day by looking at their phones,” Hale continued. “School hours are precious.”

Hale led the Stony Brook University team that developed the IRB-approved study protocol. The team then hired a survey research firm, Ipsos, to recruit a national sample of participants and complete the survey.

As part of the protocol, nearly 300 participants completed a 15-minute smartphone-based survey and installed RealityMeter to measure smartphone use. Hale and colleagues analyzed the data from the survey and constrained the sample to those who collated smartphone data for two or more school days a week, creating a total sample of 117 eligible adolescents.

In this sample, adolescents’ average smartphone use was 1.5 hours during the school day. Moreover, over 25 percent of the sampled adolescents spent more than two hours on their smartphones during school.

Excluding Internet browsing, the five most-used apps by the adolescents were text messaging, Instagram, video streaming, audio and email.

Hale and colleagues believe the results warrant the need for more similar surveys with larger sample sizes and recruitment that would include a broader segment of society. They concluded that “Parents and adolescents may derive benefit from access to phones for communication and learning purposes during school. However, application usage data from this study suggest that most school-day smartphone use appears incongruous with that purpose. The analyses show high levels of social media use during school.”

This research was supported by the Della Pietra Family Foundation.

10 May 2025

Simon DedmanBBC political reporter, East of England
PA Media Kemi Badenoch holding her hands in the air. She is wearing a black blazer over a blue top, and has her mouth open while speaking in a sitting room at a hospice.PA Media
Kemi Badenoch said she was not quitting at ""the first sign of trouble""
Kemi Badenoch said calls for her to resign as leader of the Conservative party after the local elections were ""just not serious"".

The party lost 674 councillors when voters went to the polls on 1 May, surrendering control of 16 local authorities.

Badenoch, MP for North West Essex, told the BBC she had a ""long-term plan"" and members ""knew I was going to take things slowly"".

Her comments followed Jason Smithers, the former Tory leader of North Northamptonshire Council, arguing: ""She should be resigning.""


Two-thirds of the seats defended by the Tories last week were lost to rivals, with the party receiving its lowest vote share in an election at 15%.

Badenoch said her mission as leader was to ""rebuild"" the Conservatives.

""What kind of leader would I be if I just quit at the first sign of trouble?"" she asked reporters during a visit to a hospice in Chelmsford on Friday.

'Very challenging'
The MP said it never crossed her mind to quit as leader of the opposition, adding issues faced by the party had been ""years in the making"".

She was accused by Smithers, who did not seek re-election last week, of not helping local campaigns on the doorstep.

Badenoch was also criticised by the Tory leader of Broxbourne Borough Council, in Hertfordshire, who called on her to resign for ""falling way short"".

But Badenoch retorted: ""I went to every single county that had elections.

""I said right from November, when I was elected, that it was going to be very challenging.""

Badenoch spoke to reporters while visiting a hospice in Chelmsford
The Conservative leader was asked if she was relieved elections had been cancelled in areas such as Essex this year, after the party lost counties like Kent to Reform UK.

She pointed to Cambridgeshire and Peterborough where the Tories won the mayoralty from Labour.

""Politics is changing, it was a multi-party election,"" Badenoch said.

""Essex is the same, lots of parties win here. Liberal Democrats are a challenge in Chelmsford, we have Reform, we have Labour, we have the Conservatives.

""This is what politics is looking like right now.""

Gestão de contatos
No menu principal da Duotalk, a aba de contatos é o local central para gerenciar todos os contatos de forma eficiente.
A gestão eficiente de contatos é vital para qualquer operação de atendimento ao cliente, pois garante a organização, acessibilidade e uso eficaz das informações de cada cliente para melhorar a experiência de serviço e vendas. Na plataforma Duotalk, a gestão de contatos é feita de maneira integrada e otimizada, permitindo que equipes de atendimento e vendas maximizem suas interações com os clientes.

Funcionalidades Principais da Gestão de Contatos
Aba de Contatos
No menu principal da Duotalk, a aba de contatos é o local central para gerenciar todos os contatos de forma eficiente. Essa seção permite uma comunicação mais fluida e organizada com cada cliente. Além de listar contatos, a plataforma oferece a possibilidade de registrar as etapas de qualificação de cada contato, ajudando a acompanhar e organizar a jornada de vendas ou atendimento de cada cliente.


Etapas do Contato
Na plataforma Duotalk, os contatos são classificados com base na etapa do processo de vendas em que se encontram. As etapas desse funil são integradas à base de contatos, proporcionando uma visão clara e organizada do progresso e das necessidades de cada cliente. As etapas incluem:

Lead: Um contato em potencial que demonstrou interesse, mas ainda não realizou uma compra.

Lead Qualificado: Contato com maior propensão a converter-se, após análise de interesse, orçamento, necessidade e alinhamento com o perfil ideal da empresa.

Oportunidade: Um lead qualificado que demonstrou interesse concreto e está em negociações ativas.

Cliente: Um contato que concluiu uma compra com sucesso.

Lead Perdido: Contato que não se converteu em cliente, por diversos motivos possíveis.

Spam: Contatos considerados irrelevantes ou potencialmente prejudiciais.


Tags
Com as tags, você pode categorizar e identificar as necessidades dos clientes de maneira personalizada. É possível adicionar tags com informações específicas solicitadas pelo cliente ou detalhes compartilhados durante a conversa. Isso agiliza futuras interações e permite um atendimento mais focado e eficiente.


Funcionalidades Avançadas
Bloqueio de Contatos
A Duotalk oferece uma funcionalidade de bloqueio de contatos, permitindo que administradores impeçam contatos específicos de enviar novas mensagens ou iniciar novas conversas. Esta função é crucial para gerenciar spam e evitar interações indesejadas. A lista de contatos bloqueados é facilmente acessível e administrável na página de ""Contatos"".


Importação e Exportação de Contatos
Para facilitar a gestão de grandes volumes de contatos, a Duotalk permite a importação e exportação de contatos através de arquivos CSV. Esta funcionalidade inclui uma validação para evitar duplicações e oferece a opção de download de contatos filtrados, resultando em uma base de dados organizada e atualizada.


Histórico de Contatos
A plataforma oferece acesso ao histórico completo de interações de cada contato. Ao selecionar um contato, você pode visualizar todas as conversas anteriores, solicitações de suporte e demais interações ocorridas. Isso possibilita um atendimento mais informado e personalizado, garantindo que toda a equipe esteja ciente do contexto e histórico do cliente.","company logo

761,https://havaslynx.com/news/havas-lynx-awarded-uks-best-workplaces-recognition-for-second-consecutive-year/,"Havas Lynx awarded UK’s Best Workplaces™ recognition for second consecutive year
For the second consecutive year, Havas Lynx has officially been named as one of the UK’s Best Workplaces™ 2024 by Great Place To Work®, the global authority on workplace culture. The company ranked 63rd in the Top 100 large companies list.

It follows 12-months of focus for the agency, working to improve employee experience and development. To help employees achieve their full potential, it has enhanced its leading learning and development programme, The Academy, expanding the variety of sessions available throughout the year.

To further improve the employee experience and job focus, it has also redeveloped job descriptions and changed the way it conducts performance reviews ensuring feedback is continuous and structured, allowing employees to take away actionable objectives.

At the end of 2023, the agency introduced its first Trans and Non-binary Policy in a commitment to creating a working environment everyone feels safe to come to every day.

Notable reasons why Havas Lynx has been ranked as a Great Place To Work are:

97% of people feel they are treated fairly, regardless of their sexual orientation.
94% of people said that when you join the company, you are made to feel welcome.
91% of people feel they are treated fairly, regardless of their sex.
Claire Knapp, CEO at Havas Lynx, said: “It has been a huge 12-months of focus for us, looking to improve on last year’s already strong scores. We’re thrilled to have ranked for the second consecutive year in the Top 100 list.

“It’s no secret that our people drive not just our success, but our culture and what we stand for as an agency. The passion we have to produce impact that matters shines through and glues us all together. I couldn’t be prouder to see Havas Lynx recognised this way and look forward to continuing to look for where and how we can improve – always more to be done.”

Aimee Stapleton, People Director at Havas Lynx, said: “We’re delighted to have been named a Great Place to Work for the second consecutive year. We’ve worked hard over the last 12 months to take on board feedback from last year’s survey and these results are a testament to that along with the hard work and dedication of our Lynxers.”

“At Great Place To Work® our overarching goal has consistently been to enrich the world of work by empowering companies to evolve into exceptional organisations that cater to everyone. We wholeheartedly endorse the idea that what’s ‘better for business’ aligns with what’s ‘better for people,’ ultimately contributing to a better world For All™” said Benedict Gautrey, Managing Director of Great Place To Work® UK.

“Year after year, it’s truly inspiring to witness a growing number of organisations earn a spot on our UK’s Best Workplaces™ List, we’ve seen our client’s Trust Index scores increasing meaning the bar for being on this List getting higher. This recognition is no mean feat and highlights companies across the UK that excel in fostering high levels of trust in leadership, instilling pride in their workforce, and cultivating strong camaraderie among colleagues. These crucial elements collectively contribute to creating workplaces where employees feel they can truly be themselves and thrive in a supportive environment. Congratulations to Havas Lynx for being part of our 2024 UK’s Best Workplaces™ List.”

Great Place To Work® performed rigorous evaluations of hundreds of employee survey responses alongside Culture Audit™ submissions from leaders at each company to create the 2024 UK’s Best Workplaces™ list. They then used these data insights to benchmark the effectiveness of companies’ employee value propositions against the culture their employees actually experience. Only those businesses who achieve the highest scores after evaluation receive Best Workplaces™ status.

4th April 2024

We’re delighted to have been named a Great Place to Work for the second consecutive year. We’ve worked hard over the last 12 months to take on board feedback from last year’s survey and these results are a testament to that along with the hard work and dedication of our Lynxers.

7 Reasons You Haven’t Received Your Tax Refund

Close
For investors concerned with uncertainty in 2025, here are the 11 best low-risk investments. Each offers a balance of safety, liquidity, and potential returns in a higher-rate environment. However, each investor must research the type of investments they add to their portfolio to ensure it aligns with their goals and risk threshold. The best online broker platforms offer many safe investment options, excellent research tools, and periodicals to ensure their clients are well-equipped and informed to make essential investing decisions.

Key Takeaways
Safe asset classes become more attractive when there is regulatory and market uncertainty.
Safe assets are those with a minimal risk of loss, including Treasury securities, CDs, money market funds, and bonds, which can often be found through leading online brokerage platforms.
Safer assets typically offer lower expected returns in exchange for safety.
Experts recommend maintaining a diversified portfolio correlated to your risk threshold, including a mix of low-, moderate-, and higher-risk investments.

The Risk-Reward Tradeoff of Low-Risk Investing
All investments involve a natural trade-off between risk and potential returns. Generally, assets with higher return potential also carry greater risk, while low-risk investments like CDs and treasury securities provide stable but modest returns.

Younger investors with longer time horizons can generally take on more risk, knowing they have time to recover from periodic downturns in volatile assets. Older investors nearing retirement may shift toward more low-risk securities to preserve capital.

Experts typically recommend a diversified portfolio containing a mix of low, moderate, and high-risk assets tailored to your goals, timeline, and risk tolerance. Some higher-risk assets allow for growth potential while maintaining a core of stable investments that hedge against volatility. Meanwhile, a safety net of some low-risk investments can ensure you'll be able to ride out rough patches or generate needed income in older age.

Cash
While cash isn't officially on our list, we should begin here so you have a baseline to compare the other investments below. Cash and on-demand cash deposits are the epitome of safety in the asset world. There's virtually no risk of loss (unless it is lost or stolen), making it a very reliable asset.

However, its safety comes at a cost: it generally yields minimal returns, especially when inflation runs high, reducing its purchasing power. And if you're keeping your cash in a piggy bank or under the mattress, it has no hope of earning any yield at all.

Cash is ideal for immediate or short-term financial needs due to its liquidity. It's perfect for maintaining an emergency fund or paying for immediate and upcoming expenses. Indeed, the most significant benefit of holding cash is that it is instantly accessible and universally accepted.","News

Dec 20, 2024

Person loading a heavy blue fabric into a home washing machine, illustrating the risks of washing winter fabrics at home.
There are many worst-case scenarios you can think of when you attempt to wash heavy winter fabrics at home: your favorite wool sweater shrinking to toddler size, a thick comforter coming out lumpy and uneven, or that gorgeous cashmere throw pilling beyond recognition. It’s frustrating, to say the least, and these mishaps often lead to costly replacements—or worse, the permanent loss of a cherished item.

The number one cause? Your washing machine! While it’s great for everyday laundry, most home washing machines aren’t built to handle the unique needs of heavy winter fabrics. The high agitation, improper water temperatures, and cramped drum space of a home washer can spell disaster for these seasonal staples.

Curious about what really happens to your winter garments if you insist on loading them into your home washer? Keep reading, and you’ll surely think twice before hitting that start button.

Damages Home Washing Machines Can Do to Winter Garments
Among our wardrobe staples during the cold winter are wool sweaters, cashmere scarves, down-filled jackets, and fleece-lined comforters. These garments and home essentials need careful handling and specialized cleaning to maintain their structure, texture, and functionality. If the thought of tossing them into your washer has ever crossed your mind, think again.

Below, we break down the most common ways home washing machines can ruin your winter wardrobe—and why it happens.

1. Shrinkage
Wool and cashmere are highly sensitive to water temperature and agitation. Even a single wash cycle with warm or hot water can cause these fabrics to shrink significantly, leaving you with garments that no longer fit.

2. Distorted Shape
The constant spinning and agitation in a washing machine can stretch out or distort delicate fabrics like wool and fleece. Sweaters may lose their shape, and scarves can become uneven, ruining their tailored or structured look.

3. Pilling
Fabrics like cashmere and fleece are prone to pilling when subjected to the rough agitation of a washer. Those small, unsightly fabric balls can make even the highest quality garments look worn and old.

4. Loss of Insulation
Down-filled jackets and comforters rely on their fluffy filling to keep you warm. Washing machines can compress or clump the down, reducing its insulating properties and leaving your outerwear or bedding less effective in combating the cold.

5. Color Fading or Bleeding
Brightly colored winter garments, especially those made of wool or fleece, can fade or bleed when exposed to harsh detergents and washing conditions. This not only affects the original piece but can also ruin other items in the same load.

6. Tears and Snags
The zippers, buttons, or hooks on heavy winter garments can get caught in the machine, leading to rips or snags in the fabric. Fleece-lined or quilted pieces are especially susceptible to this kind of damage.

7. Trapped Moisture
Thick fabrics like down or fleece are difficult to dry thoroughly in a home dryer. This can leave your garments damp and lead to mildew or unpleasant odors if not addressed promptly.

8. Loss of Softness
The wrong detergent or washing technique can strip cashmere and wool of their natural oils, leaving them scratchy and uncomfortable to wear.

Can You Dry Clean Clothes at Home? Here’s What to Consider
Dry cleaning at home might sound like a great way to save time and money, but before diving in, there are a few important things you need to know. While at-home dry cleaning kits are available, they aren’t a perfect replacement for professional services. Let’s break it down into a simple, step-by-step guide so you can decide if this method works for you and your garments.","Urban Valet Cleaners logo banner celebrating 30 years of excellence, featuring the number ""30"" and the years 1995-2025 in a vibrant green and purple design.

Last Updated Feb 14, 2024

  
With its perennial issues of product perishability, temperature controls and delivery timeliness, food and beverage logistics has never been an easy undertaking. Now the new year brings a fresh slate of challenges for the world’s food and beverage shippers. With decades of specialized industry expertise and hands-on experience moving consumable goods, Redwood takes a look at the biggest issues in the food and beverage industry this year.   

Logistics Complexity Threatens to Take a Bite Out of Profits 

Labor shortages, rising fuel costs and growing customer expectations will continue to pressure profitability this year. Food and beverage manufacturers are grappling with the challenge of delivering more products directly to consumers’ homes, balancing high service levels with the high costs of last-mile delivery. Many companies are realizing that it’s nearly impossible to accomplish this profitably with their existing tools and processes.  

Extreme weather events, ongoing geopolitical instability and trade barriers will also make the work of logistics teams more challenging in 2024. When managing perishable products, it’s essential to achieve predictable transportation results, even in unpredictable conditions. It’s critical to recognize and mitigate disruptions at the earliest opportunity, pivoting both strategically and profitably in response. Again, many companies are beginning this year with a growing sense that their current logistics practices and technology may not be up to managing these complex challenges.    

We recently spoke with a Transportation Manager at an enterprise Food & Beverage company about the tough situation food and beverage shippers find themselves in today. “Our biggest challenges include freight market volatility, including fluctuations in fuel and other costs, as well as general economic uncertainty,” he said. “Demand volatility is also a huge challenge. It’s clear we’ve shifted from a supply-driven environment to a demand-driven one. But how do we plan and keep pace with demand changes?”

While our contact pointed out that artificial intelligence (AI) and other emerging technologies seem promising, he noted that technology adoption can itself form an obstacle. “How do shippers select the right technology to keep pace with changing conditions — and lean into it?” he added.   

These challenges are nothing new for Redwood, which has decades of hands-on experience in the global food and beverage industry. From multimodal transportation and warehousing to freight brokerage services and proprietary technology, Redwood has what it takes to address the complexities of 2024 and beyond. With an unmatched ability to optimize both cost and service levels, Redwood is already helping many of the world’s food and beverage leaders master their difficult logistics challenges — and you can directly benefit from this expertise.

Consumers and Regulators Thirst for Sustainability 

With a growing awareness of climate change, both shoppers and legislators are looking closely at the environmental practices of food and beverage manufacturers. From sustainable agricultural and production practices to recyclable packaging, consumers are becoming more conscious of manufacturers’ environmental impacts when they make their product choices. And regulators are enacting tighter sustainability regulations every day. 

Of course, first- to last-mile logistics plays an enormous role in sustainability. But emissions and other impacts can be challenging for food and beverage companies to track, especially when their supply chains span multiple continents and multiple supplier tiers.

Redwood can help, with its proprietary Hyperion solution that’s purpose-built to support carbon neutrality. This one-of-a-kind solution provides automated, detailed, load-by-load emissions calculations, along with robust reporting capabilities. Food and beverage producers can not only monitor and reduce their carbon footprints, but easily communicate their sustainability results to consumers, regulators and other stakeholders.

Manufacturers Face a Menu of Emerging Challenges 

Each year seems to highlight new logistics challenges, and 2024 is no exception. Here are a few emerging pressures food and beverage manufactures should be aware of this year: 

Innovative products require special handling. One of the biggest developments in the global food industry is the growing popularity of plant-based and cultured meat alternatives. While these products offer health and sustainability benefits, they’re also introducing new storage and transportation requirements. Make sure your transportation team is in synch with your product development team as your company introduces any innovations. 
Food safety is in the spotlight. It seems like every day brings new headlines about food safety, contamination and product recalls. In today’s competitive food and beverage landscape, even one mistake can prove disastrous in terms of establishing consumer confidence and loyalty. The world’s logistics teams need to be hyper-vigilant in ensuring food safety and quality, applying best handling practices, and complying with government regulations. 
Network models are evolving. More companies are exploring reshoring and nearshoring, as they recognize the benefits of shifting production closer to consumers. Logistics teams need to play a big role in any reimagining of the supply chain model. New transportation routes, distribution networks and delivery practices will be required — and companies need to understand and factor in these impacts from the earliest stages of network redesign.  
Advanced technologies are in the spotlight. Automation and AI have justifiably become industry buzzwords, thanks to their ability to increase efficiency and reduce costs. But these advanced technologies need to be integrated strategically into logistics operations, with a full understanding of hidden costs such as job displacement and workforce retraining.

Abstract
We show that the largest increase in unemployment benefits in US history had large spending impacts and small job-finding impacts. This finding has three implications. First, increased benefits were important for explaining aggregate spending dynamics—but not employment dynamics—during the pandemic. Second, benefit expansions allow us to study the MPC of normally low-liquidity households in a high-liquidity state. These households still have high MPCs. This suggests a role for permanent behavioral characteristics, rather than just current liquidity, in driving spending behavior. Third, the mechanisms driving our results imply that temporary benefit supplements are a promising countercyclical tool.

House Price Models
Land Registry House Price Index Model
This model uses changes in the Official Land Registry House Price Index for CORNWALL to estimate the market value.

When this house was purchased in October 2010 the House Price Index for CORNWALL was 58.5.

The House Price Index as of 1 Jul 2025 is 101.3 which is a change of 73.162%.
Applying this 73.162% change to the original purchase price of £200,000 results in an estimated price of approximately £346,324.

26 Oct 2010	1 Jul 2025	% change	Purchase Price	Gain / Loss	Estimated Price
58.5	101.3	73.162 %	£200,000	£146,324	£346,324
Postcode Pricing Model for TR12
The Postcode Pricing Model uses changes in average sales price within the TR12 postcode to calculate an estimated price.
The average sales price when the house was purchased is compared with the current average sales price.
This change is then applied to the initial purchase price to derive the current estimated price.
Three different estimates are shown, with averages drawn from 1 month, 3 month and 6 month timeframes.
The longer timeframes give less volatile estimates, but are not so timely.

Summary
Group decision making techniques provide cross-functional teams the framework to foster constructive discussions regarding important business decisions. Learn about how you can use group decision making frameworks to make decisions quickly.

Making a decision for a group of people can be a major undertaking. Things get even more complicated when you’re making crucial business decisions and have to consider finances, investor needs, and the goals of different cross-functional teams. Establishing a decision-making framework ahead of time helps you to reduce external distractions and follow a predetermined series of steps to make the most logical decision as a group. Using group decision-making frameworks can help cross-functional teams make the right decisions quickly.

What is a group decision-making technique?
A group decision-making technique is a framework that you can use to help a group with several decision makers. These frameworks can be especially helpful when you’re working with decision makers across teams and departments because they help provide decision makers with the different perspectives from cross-functional teams. The best kind of group decision-making techniques takes the opinion of everyone in the group into consideration. Using the right group decision-making technique for the right project can help save your team time, increase efficiency, and encourage collaboration. 

5 tips for making good group decisions
Making good group decisions is important, especially when working with cross-functional teams. To ensure that you include everyone’s opinions, use these tips: 

Clarify the goal and category of the decision. Making a group decision can be challenging if you’re working cross-functionally. This is because each team has its own individual goal and needs for a final decision. It’s also important to consider the category of the decision. Type one decisions are decisions that are extremely challenging to reverse. Type two decisions are reversible, easily fixed, and reversed if the outcome doesn’t quite reflect what your team expected. Make sure it’s clear to everyone on the team how permanent this decision is. 

Keep the decision-making group small, but diverse. While there may be a lot of people affected by your decision, keeping your decision-making group small can help maintain agility. It’s important to create a diverse group of people because it encourages discussion from team members with different viewpoints. When considering who to choose, try to incorporate members from the teams that will be most impacted by the decision. Make sure team leaders receive input from the team members they manage, so the decision isn’t made in an executive silo.

Use a RACI chart. Before even making a decision, using a RACI chart ensures that everybody on the decision-making group understands their role and responsibilities within this specific decision-making process.

Foster a safe discussion space. Decision-making requires a lot of brainstorming, discussion, and sharing of ideas. Fostering a safe space is an important part of establishing a psychologically safe workplace for your employees. The more your team is willing to share ideas, the more likely it is that your team will make great decisions for your company. 

Communicate the final decision clearly. Once the decision is made, it should be communicated to those who are impacted efficiently. This is a good opportunity to develop a communication plan to ensure that everyone gets the information they need.

The 6 different group decision-making techniques
Making a decision within a group of people is challenging when there’s no structure involved. This is especially true when business leaders have to make decisions across different departments that all have their own goals to consider. Here are six different decision-making processes that you can use to help groups find the right decision for them.

1. Traditional brainstorming
Basic brainstorming is one of the easiest ways to get ideas flowing within a group of people. During this time, everyone comes up with different possible end decisions and shares their ideas with the team, but no ideas are turned down until later. While this type of decision-making strategy is great for coming up with potential ideas, it’s rarely used to make a final decision. 

Using a brain dump template keeps those raw notes organized so the group can focus on weighing decisions instead of struggling to recall ideas in the moment.

Good for: Generating new ideas, getting input from the entire group

2. Decision tree analysis
A decision tree analysis is a type of chart that maps out how one decision can result in many different outcomes. Think of this strategy like the butterfly effect—your team is looking at many different potential outcomes based on one single decision. This technique works really well when you’re trying to look for a solution to a long-term issue. It works especially well for cross-functional teams, because then everyone can visualize how it affects different parts of the business.  A decision tree can help your team identify potential risks and problems with other solutions, which can help save time and money in the long run. 

Good for: Identifying how a single decision can affect different teams or departments","

Nordstrom Reports Holiday Sales, Updates Outlook
 ,   /PRNewswire/ -- Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) today announced a total Company net sales increase of 4.9 percent and a comparable sales increase of 5.8 percent for the nine-week holiday period ended January 4, 2025, compared with the nine weeks ended December 30, 2023. For the Nordstrom banner, net sales increased 3.7 percent and comparable sales increased 6.5 percent, while Nordstrom Rack banner net sales increased 7.4 percent and comparable sales increased 4.3 percent.

""As a result of our efforts to remain competitive in the promotional environment and the strength of our offering, our holiday sales in November and December exceeded the expectations we shared during our most recent earnings call,"" said Erik Nordstrom, chief executive officer of Nordstrom, Inc. ""For the full year, we're raising our topline outlook and reaffirming our profitability guidance.""

Chatbot - Lógica de Saída do Bloco de Condição: Quando o ""Não"" é a Saída Positiva
Na automação de fluxos/chatbots, o bloco de condição é responsável por direcionar os leads com base em regras definidas. Mas e quando queremos que a saída positiva aconteça quando algo não ocorre?

Isso é totalmente possível, e depende de como a condição foi configurada.

Exemplo:



Você criou a seguinte condição:

Condição configurada: “O lead possui uma oportunidade?”

Operador escolhido: NÃO (ou seja, “O lead não possui uma oportunidade”).

Ação esperada: Quando essa condição for verdadeira (ou seja, o lead realmente não possui uma oportunidade), ele deve seguir pela saída positiva.


Como funciona a lógica nesse caso?

A lógica pode ser entendida assim:

A saída positiva é ativada quando a condição configurada for VERDADEIRA.

A saída negativa é ativada quando a condição configurada for FALSA.


Dica importante 💡

A chave para entender isso está no jeito que você escreve/configura a condição:

Se você escreve a condição de forma afirmativa, como “O lead possui oportunidade?”, então a saída positiva será acionada quando ele possuir.

Mas se você escreve a condição de forma negativa, como “O lead não possui oportunidade?”, então a saída positiva será acionada quando ele de fato não possuir.


Conclusão

A saída positiva não significa sempre que a resposta é “Sim” para o enunciado original, mas sim que a condição completa configurada é verdadeira. Então, se a condição que você configurou é ""O lead não possui oportunidade"" e isso for verdade, a saída positiva será seguida.

While most 3D printed construction projects we cover rely on cement-based materials to build structures layer by layer, a Dutch company is proposing an alternative method that uses bio-based composites to print compact homes and office spaces. The company, Silva.builders, recently erected its first official build: a 3D printed break shelter for Qbuzz bus drivers in the town of Oosterwolde, southwest of Groningen.

Like other construction 3D printing companies, Silva.builders is interested in providing a more sustainable alternative to conventional building processes, while also addressing the need for more affordable housing. Unlike many other companies in the growing segment, however, Silva.builders is leveraging a different material source: a bio-based composite made up of recycled plastic and natural fibers. The material, the company emphasizes, is itself fully recyclable and meets building requirements for fire safety and UV resistance.

Silva.builders 3D printed building bio-based composite

The company’s first finished building in Oosterwolde, made from this sustainable material, was reportedly printed in just a few days and will function both as a shelter and as a pilot project for the company’s 3D printing solution. Located in Natura 2000, a protected natural area, the 3D printed structure also conforms to the sustainability requirements of the zone.

In terms of building design, Silva.builders has created a selection of pre-designed models that come with a variety of personalization options. For example, it has office space models and small living models ideal for those looking for a minimalist lifestyle. “We combine the power of digital manufacturing with circular material use and add the design of top architects,” explains Gerard van der Hoeven, Founder of Silva.builders. “This allows us to create buildings that are ready for the future.” Of course, customers can also choose to design their own homes. In all cases, the Silva.builders team starts with a consultation and a feasibility check at the location to make sure that the required zoning, access and utilities are in place.

The construction itself is done at Silva.builders site, where a robotic 3D printer makes pre-fab components, which are then transported to the final location and assembled. “This technology allows us to efficiently produce high-quality, circular spaces, significantly reducing costs and lead times,” the company says. “The silva robot operates around the clock, requiring minimal human intervention, ensuring both cost-efficiency and speed.

Pipeline Owners Await a Cash Flow Gusher
Crude, Natural Gas Liquids, The Daley Note
Posted by:

Gina
The Daley Note: June 2, 2023


Many pipelines will see a record tariff increase of up to 13.3% starting as early as July 1, setting the stage for higher sustained asset cash flows in East Daley Analytics’ Financial Blueprints.

On May 16, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) released its updated tariff adjustment for liquids pipelines (Oil, NGLs, Refined Products) that use indexed rates. The tariff structure allows pipelines to adjust their shipping rates once a year, based on price changes as measured by the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods (PPI-FG).

Sustained inflationary pressures in 2022 resulted in a tariff ceiling value of 1.133194, FERC determined, the highest increase ever for the tariff structure. Pipeline owners can raise rates up to the tariff ceiling beginning July 1, 2023.

tdn 6.1

The record ceiling index will eclipse the prior high of 1.087107 posted last year, setting the stage for another year of strong gains for select pipeline systems. East Daley tracks asset ownership, rates and performance for pipelines in our company Financial Blueprints. DCP Midstream (DCP), Enterprise Products (EPD), Energy Transfer (ET), Magellan Midstream (MMP), NuStar (NU) and Plains All American (PAA) are some of the owners of pipelines that use indexed tariffs.

Inflation began to pick up after Covid lockdowns ended in 2021, the result of pent-up consumer demand, snarled supply chains and government stimulus. Commodity prices then jumped in 2022 following Russia’s attack on Ukraine, kicking inflationary pressures up to 40-year highs. The Y-o-Y growth rate in PPI-FG reached a peak of 18.3% in June 2022. Over the past year, the PPI-FG index has continued to increase, but at a more modest rate (see figure).

Most pipeline owners were able to pass along the full 8.7% rate increase last year in uncommitted (recourse) rates, a good sign of the potential gains ahead. In some cases, committed rates also received the full rate increase, but there is significant variance in the contracts behind committed rates between pipelines and shippers. Pipeline owners that pass along the full rate increase should see gains in cash flow starting in 3Q23. – Zach Krause Tickers: DCP, EPD, ET, MMP, NU, PAA.

Your email or name
A previous password or password from another website
Consecutive keyboard combinations, like ""qwerty"" or ""asdfg""
Names such as your company name or names of spouses, kids, other relatives, or pets
Personal numbers, like your age or birth date
Using the same passwords for email, banking, and social media accounts can make you more susceptible to identity theft.
Do use:
At least eight characters, but the longer the better
A mix of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols

Iban Garcia (Azcoitia, 1999) es uno de los rostros más importantes de TikTok en España, donde acumula casi tres millones de seguidores, y ahora se postula como una de las revelaciones del mundo de la televisión poniéndose al frente del 'reality' 'Los vecinos de la casa de al lado' de Mediaset. Ya hay quien lo compara con Jorge Javier Vázquez: ""Dicen que ven el reflejo de él en mí como la nueva generación. A mí me parece un halago que me comparen con una persona que tanto admiro y he visto durante toda mi vida"".

La segunda temporada del programa exclusivo de Mitele Plus 'Los vecinos de la casa de al lado' reúne a seis participantes de la última edición de 'La isla de las tentaciones', Alba Rodríguez, Sthefany Pérez, Bayan, Álvaro Rubio, Mayeli y Gerard, con algunas cuentas pendientes, y muestra su convivencia con conexión 24 horas en dos apartamentos acristalados situados uno frente al otro. El formato tiene galas en directo los lunes y los miércoles, presentadas por García, y una expulsión semanal.

El éxito de los 'realities'
Mediaset sigue así explotando el gran éxito del 'reality' de parejas de Telecinco, que superó todos los datos de audiencia y dio la vuelta al mundo con el 'fenómeno Montoya'. ""Para mí ha sido muy gratificante y placentero ver cómo la gente joven ha vuelto a engancharse a la televisión lineal"", valora el presentador. ""El público joven muchas veces es difícil de convencer porque tenemos un abanico muy grande de opciones audiovisuales"", añade.

""Yo siempre diré que el futuro de la televisión está en la sinergia entre lo digital y lo lineal, saber complementarse y aprovechar todas las opciones que nos da la comunicación"", reflexiona el 'tiktoker'. También se muestra feliz de que las nuevas generaciones puedan aspirar a estos cargos: ""Tienes que apostar por nuevas caras y nuevas formas de comunicar"".


Un sueño cumplido
Con este nuevo proyecto, García cumple uno de sus sueños con tan solo 25 años: convertirse en presentador de un 'reality'. ""Nunca pensé que esto llegaría tan pronto y tan de repente porque todavía tengo toda la vida por delante y estoy aprendiendo"", asegura emocionado. Sin embargo, se enfrentó a los primeros miedos y presiones cuando le presentaron el proyecto: ""No sabía cuándo me iban a dar la oportunidad de hacer algo así porque nunca lo había hecho. Tengo que estar a la altura de todas esas personas que han tomado esta decisión"".

En este nuevo papel, García muestra una nueva faceta muy diferente a la que enseña en sus redes sociales. ""Mi objetivo es ser natural, que la gente conecte conmigo y con el programa y que disfruten junto a mí del 'reality' en directo. No puedo evitar emocionarme por todo lo que está pasando y transmitir lo que estoy viviendo"", asegura. ""La gente disfruta de lo inesperado, de la espontaneidad y de lo que sale del guion y la escaleta. Ahí está la magia de la televisión"", manifiesta.","Temas

Doseringsskema til seniorheste
God planlægning gør det lettere at fodre i hverdagen
Derfor anbefaler vi, at du sætter dig ind i, hvad der har størst betydning for din hests behov (afgørende faktorer) – og hvordan vi vurderer den samlede arbejdsmængden.

Doseringerne normal, ekstra og maksimal er en vigtig del af planlægningen, så du rammer det niveau, der passer til din hest.

Seniorheste, 15-18+ år, har brug for flere vitaminer og mineraler end yngre heste fordi:
1. Nedsat optagelse og udnyttelse
Med alderen bliver tarmens evne til at optage næringsstoffer mindre effektiv. Det betyder, at selv ved samme foderindtag, får hesten mindre udbytte af vitaminer og mineraler.

2. Tandslid og tyggeproblemer
Seniorheste kan ofte have nedsat tyggeevne pga. slidte tænder, tandtab eller tandspidser. Det kan gøre det sværere at udnytte grovfoder optimalt – som jo ellers er en vigtig kilde til mineraler.
Resultat: lavere mikronæringsstofindtag fra foderet.
 

Forarbejdet er vigtigt når det skal være let for dig at fodre i hverdagen. Vi opfordrer dig til at læse mere om de afgørende faktorer og hvordan vi beregner arbejdsmængden for din hest. Normal, Ekstra og Maksimal doseringerne er lige så vigtige for din planlægning.

  Dette doseringsskema dækker både Every Day Happy og Peak Performance  

OBS! Vi anbefaler 1-2 spsk. salt sammen med den daglige dosis af Every Day Happy eller Peak Performance

Vigtigt: Har du ikke en mineralanalyse af dit grovfoder?

Så anbefaler vi, at du følger ""Ekstra""-niveauet i vores doseringsskema. Det er den bedste måde at sikre, at din hest får nok af de vigtige mikromineraler – også selvom du ikke kender præcis, hvad der er i grovfoderet.

Hvis du derimod har en analyse, og tallene for mineralindholdet er nogenlunde som her, kan du trygt bruge den normale dosering af f.eks. Every Day Happy, Peak Performance eller Supreme Minerals:

Kobber: 4–5 mg/kg
Zink: 20–22 mg/kg
Mangan: 40–50 mg/kg
Jern: 100–110 mg/kg
Da heste kun optager en lille del af jernet i grovfoder (typisk 10–15 %), og mange analyser viser lave værdier, anbefaler vi ofte ""Ekstra til Maksimal""-niveauet, hvis grovfoderet er lavt på især jern.

Let arbejde/fold
Alle doseringer er i gram og angiver den daglige mængde som din hest skal fodres med.

Drægtige og diegivende seniorhopper.
Drægtige hopper fodres indtil 8. måned i forhold til deres arbejdsmængde. Fra 9. til 11. måned fodres de som ved modrat arbejde.

De første 3 måneder efter foling fodres hoppen som ved krævende arbejde. Indtil føllet fravænnes fodres hoppen som ved moderat arbejde.

Er hoppen både drægtig og diegivende, fordres hun som efter krævende arbejde i alle de diegivende måneder. Når føllet er fravænnet, følges anbefalingerne for den drægtige hoppe som beskrevet ovenfor.

 

Foderplan
Hvis du er i tvivl om hvordan din hest skal fodres, hvis den har specielle behov eller er udfordret på nogen måde, kan du bestille en konsultation med vores ernæringskonsulent og få udarbejdet en individuel foderplan.

Ascension is notifying over 100,000 people that their personal information was stolen in a data breach potentially linked to the Cleo hack.

Non-profit healthcare system Ascension Health is notifying over 100,000 people that their personal and health information was stolen in a third-party data breach.

The data was stolen after hackers exploited a vulnerability in third-party software that a former business partner was using. Ascension inadvertently exposed the compromised information to that business partner.

The organization says it learned of the data breach on December 5, 2024, which, given its description of the incident, suggests that it was linked to the Cleo hack that affected dozens of entities.

As part of the attack on Cleo’s file transfer platform, the notorious Cl0p ransomware group exploited two zero-day flaws to exfiltrate data from numerous organizations, including car rental giant Hertz Corporation and Western Alliance Bank.

Ascension, which runs one of the largest healthcare systems in the US, appears to have been affected as well, through the former business partner that it did not name.

In an incident notice this week, the organization revealed that personal and health information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, email addresses, Social Security numbers, diagnosis details, insurance information, and inpatient visit details were stolen in the attack.

Ascension is providing the potentially affected individuals with two years of free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services.

The organization did not say how many individuals might have been affected by the data breach, but said the stolen information pertained to patients at its locations in Alabama, Michigan, Indiana, Tennessee, and Texas.

Industrial Cybersecurity Conference
Notices sent to Massachusetts and Texas authorities show that more than 114,700 people were affected. SecurityWeek has emailed Ascension for additional information on the incident and will update this article if a reply arrives.

Last year, Ascension disclosed a data breach that affected roughly 5.6 million individuals. The incident occurred in May 2024 and was said to be the result of a BlackBasta ransomware attack.

What is a Vertical Marketing Strategy? 

Are you seeking a way to gain an edge in the competitive business world? A vertical marketing strategy involves business entities forming partnerships to produce and distribute products and services. This type of collaboration involves multiple companies working together in one supply chain.

The advantages of a vertical marketing strategy are numerous, including cost savings, increased efficiency, better control over pricing, and increased market share. Matrix Marketing Group and Microsoft also offer industry solutions to help businesses successfully deploy this model.

This blog post will explore how a vertical marketing strategy can benefit your organization, including vertical marketing vs. horizontal marketing, developing a vertical market strategy, and horizontal marketing strategy.

Are you looking to gain an edge in the competitive business world?

A vertical marketing strategy involves business entities forming partnerships to produce and distribute products and services. This type of collaboration involves multiple companies working together in one supply chain, from manufacturers to distributors to retailers. The advantages of account-based marketing include cost savings, increased efficiency, better control over pricing, and increased market share.

Businesses can easily deploy this model with the help of industry solutions offered by Matrix Marketing Group and Microsoft. An account-based marketing plan can benefit your organization significantly by providing cost savings, increased efficiency, better control over pricing, and increased market share.

Much like ABM, vertical marketing starts with researching a target vertical and focusing your strategy on attracting and closing those times of companies.

What is a Vertical Marketing Strategy?
Vertical Marketing Strategy
Vertical marketing is a strategic approach that involves two or more companies working together in the same supply chain, from manufacturers to distributors to retailers. This partnership aims to produce and distribute products and services more efficiently and cost-effectively and effectively control pricing across all levels. This collaboration allows for increased market penetration and higher customer satisfaction through improved customer service and better product availability.

One key advantage of using account-based marketing is cost savings. By collaborating with other companies in the supply chain, businesses can benefit from each other’s buying power and reduce operational costs associated with inventory management, warehousing, and shipping logistics. Additionally, by pooling resources across different levels of the supply chain, companies can reduce labor costs associated with marketing, research, and development.

Another important advantage of vertical marketing is increased efficiency. By streamlining operations between multiple partners in the supply chain, companies can reduce the time it takes for products to reach customers and improve customer response times. Furthermore, with increased cooperation between manufacturers and retailers in product design and innovation, businesses can stay ahead by offering new products before competitors.","ai matrix marketing group logo

Insight and Press blog post featured image
Written by Will Goodwin, co-founder, Tumelo.
 
Pass-through voting enables fund managers to offer the cost benefits of a pooled fund to their investors whilst giving them the control over their voting that a segregated mandate offers.


Allowing institutional investors to meet their fiduciary duty
Institutional investors are under increasing pressure from regulators and industry bodies to take a view on the stewardship practices of the funds they use. They are still incredibly price sensitive, but now also need to take into account the vote policies of funds.

But, in the proxy space, today's state of play presents challenges for institutional investors. Especially in cases where their votes are opposing themselves.


How does that happen?
Scenario 1: The institutional investor uses a segregated mandate as well as pooled funds. The investor is voting their shares in the segregated mandate, whilst the fund manager of the pooled fund could be placing an opposing vote on the same proposals.
Scenario 2: The institutional investor exclusively invests through pooled funds across various managers. Fund managers can then vote in opposing ways to each other on the same proposals.
Typically, the institutional investor would have set up a segregated mandate to take control of their voting; however, this comes with additional fixed costs, fees and complexity for the fund manager.


Here's a great solution
Tumelo allows the fund manager to pass the vote down to the institutional investor while still accommodating them within a pooled fund structure, delivering a low-cost product that offers the same flexibility as a segregated mandate.

Fund managers can onboard institutional investors by simply sending them a link to the digital platform and asking them to sign up.


What does it look like in practice?
Institutional investors get access to a first-class user experience that allows them to vote directly or set up a voting policy. They can also fulfil all of their reporting requirements from the same platform.

 

Mobile screens for Tumelo's vote policy picker. Featuring Glass Lewis and As you sow. UserTumelo –  journey for institutional investors.

Delivering an exceptional retail-investor experience
Retail investors should have the same rights as other unit holders. If the opportunity for pass-through voting is available to institutional investors, it should be available to retail investors on the same terms.

However, there are challenges whereby funds may be composed of thousands of underlying companies making it an impossible task for the retail investor to vote each proxy manually. Coupled with the information disadvantage that a retail investor has relative to an institutional investor or fund manager, it makes for a challenging experience.

Tumelo solves this challenge by offering the retail investor a selection of vote policies they can set and apply to their shares. Investors have real-time access to upcoming AGMs and the vote direction for their shares, even choosing to override the vote policy recommendation when they disagree.","Tumelo Logo

August 5, 2024
Zamorano News
 
 

To strengthen the English language skills of the student body, English Pronunciation Workshop was held, developed by Master Diego Diaz, professor of English and linguist guest. This activity, aimed at first year students enrolled in the English Foundations program, allowed them to learn relevant information about specific sounds of the English language, understand the importance of the vocal and articulatory apparatus and its function when pronouncing words. 



The activity was organized in collaboration with the Directorate of General Curriculum and the Associate Dean of Students (DAE) with the active support of English teachers. The activity provided students with the opportunity to improve their speaking and listening skills, thus complementing the learning acquired in the English classes they receive in the program. 

During the event, students had the opportunity to understand the importance of identifying the different sounds, as well as the articulation of these sounds to stimulate a correct pronunciation of words. Through the discrimination and practice of sounds, the development of this activity seeks to motivate students to develop phonological awareness, improve the pronunciation of the sounds of the English language. At the same time, it promotes a more intelligible pronunciation which fosters effective communication. 

Activities such as these promote academic quality and the development of essential skills for effective communication in English as a global language.

Security and safety services delivered
We provide solutions with the utmost consideration for security, safety, and improvement of operational efficiency to our customers,based on the expertise we have cultivated within the SHI Group.

Features
1Equipment security duties
Various sensors are installed in facilities that are subject to security surveillance, such as the offices and buildings of our customers, which are monitored and guarded from the base stations of the SHI Group around the clock.
When an abnormal incident occurs, such as an intrusion by a suspicious individual, sensors detect the incident, and on-duty security guards are immediately dispatched from the closest standby station, while law enforcement and emergency responders are also notified of the emergency depending on the situation.

2Facility security
Security guards are posted permanently at a building, manufacturing plant, or school to control entry to and exit from the facilities, to guard against intrusion by suspicious individuals and to prevent accidents.

3Traffic direction and crowd control security
Vehicles are directed at the entrances and exits of construction sites or parking lots to maintain the safety of pedestrians and other vehicles.
People and vehicles are also given directions or guided during events or festivities to alleviate congestion and to prevent accidents.

4Security patrols
Security guards patrol offices, stores, buildings, or manufacturing plants at regular and irregular intervals for inspections and to verify safety.

5Failure responses
The status of equipment and devices installed at remote locations outdoors or indoors is monitored at all times. When an abnormal incident occurs, the status is verified and recovery actions are taken rapidly.

6Video monitoring
Cameras are installed in secured areas to transmit video images to SHI Group base stations, where they are monitored and warnings are issued when an intrusion by a suspicious person is detected. Two-way communication can be undertaken with visitors by installing a microphone or other appropriate equipment.

Installation case example
1The following is an example of installation in a building where the first floor is an office, while the second and third floors are residential space.
Various installation plans are available to suit different building conditions, as well as customers' budgets and goals.
Please contact the SHI Group for more information.


Passive sensors (infrared sensors)
These are sensors that are installed on ceilings or other locations to detect the body temperature (by infrared) of any suspicious individuals intruding into the secured perimeters, and send out warning signals.

Magnet sensors
These are sensors that are installed on windows and other locations that can be opened, to detect intruders. They consist of two components, the switch and the magnet. Sensors detect the opening or closing of the window, and then send out warning signals.

Shutter sensors
These sensors are installed on shutters in parking garages and warehouses to detect the opening and closing of such shutters.

Glass fracture sensors
These sensors detect damage to window glass and jolts, and send out warning signals.

Transmitters
These are devices that control sensors that have been installed at secured perimeters, and send signals concerning abnormal incidents via online connections to SHI Group base stations. The controller at the base station receives the signal notifying the station of an abnormal incident, and then issues a dispatch order. Security guards who receive such orders are immediately dispatched to the site.

Card readers
Card readers are used to activate or de-activate security functions from outside the secured perimeter. These are ordinarily installed near entrances and exits, where cards are read before activating or de-activating security functions.

Emergency alarm buttons
These buttons are installed at inconspicuous locations, such as under desks or counters. They are used to notify outside parties of the occurrence of abnormal events inside.

Heat and smoke detectors
These detectors are installed on ceilings for early detection of fires. The sensors send out warning signals when they detect that temperature or heat has exceeded a certain level.

Safe sensors
These sensors detect when a safe has been moved or toppled over, as well as when the safe doors have been opened, and send out warning signals.","Sumitomo Heavy Industries, Ltd.

一带一路十周年 | 欧亚丝带 一路繁花 ---中国电建欧亚区域总部践行“一带一路”十年发展纪实
来源：欧亚区域总部 日期：2023-11-24 作者：王薇 字数：6560
今年是共建“一带一路”倡议提出十周年。十年来，在亚欧大陆这个世界上人口最多、国家最多、文明最具多样性的地区，中国电建欧亚区域总部坚定中国电建国际业务“三步走”全球发展战略，发挥规划先行、产业联动、“投建营”产业链一体化优势，以区域总部所在地塞尔维亚为指挥中心，管辖欧亚两大洲63个国别市场。中国电建同“一带一路”共建国一道，高举发展、合作、共赢旗帜，共享机遇、共克时艰、共创未来，创新开拓欧亚国际市场，用精品工程铸造品牌，用真情换真心履行央企社会责任，以“高标准、可持续、惠民生”为目标，建设造福欧亚各国、惠及当地民众的“幸福路”，从“走出去”到“留下来”，积极打造属地化平台，在欧亚国际市场中树立了中国电建良好品牌形象。

可持续发展十年一带繁花一路歌

十年来，欧亚区域总部紧跟国际市场和全球形势变化，精耕“一带一路”重点国别市场，深入研究并结合所在国资源开发和基础设施建设发展规划，持续创新商业模式，携手集团成员企业发挥全产业链和“投建营”一体化优势，在欧盟市场以EPC+EF模式向价值链上游发展。与外部投资人签署开发服务协议，凭借提供优质项目资源和开发服务来分享项目成功开发后的增值收益；以RTB+EPC模式在意大利、希腊推进新能源项目。

务实合作开拓第三方市场。加强与“一带一路”国家具备相关能力、能够与公司形成能力互补优势的企业在第三方市场合作；加强与合作伙伴之间多层次沟通，建立相互信任和良好沟通机制，与英国、美国、日本等国的知名企业分别在孟加国、巴基斯坦、尼泊尔等国别进行合作。

高端推动“一带一路”市场走深走实。聚焦“中巴、孟中印缅、中蒙俄”经济走廊和中国-中东欧国家合作，在历届“一带一路”国际合作高峰论坛期间，组织、参加20余场高层商务活动，取得丰硕成果。动态调整欧亚布局。十年来，根据国际环境各种因素不断变化，欧亚区域以“做强重点国别推动做强区域总部”为思路，系统分析、综合研判市场形势并适时对营销重心作出调整，优化资源配置、降低运营成本，更好实现资源协同，集中优势资源聚焦、做强、做优、做实重点国别。欧亚区域设立“欧洲、地中海、中亚俄、南亚一、南亚二”五大次区域，以“稳住南亚、做强欧洲、做大中亚俄”的市场定位推动欧亚区域进入新发展阶段。

目前欧亚所辖63个国别，有25个国别派员常驻，在31个国别开展市场开发业务。投身“一带一路”建设十年来，中国电建在欧亚区域新签合同额累计近5500亿元，多个项目填补了电建集团全球市场相关领域地域空白。中国电建在欧亚市场上开创的不仅仅是发展动力、成长空间，更是与“一带一路”共建国共同拥抱新时代，抢抓新机遇，书写欧亚大陆“人类命运共同体”的奋斗历程。

孟加拉国达舍尔甘地污水处理厂是习近平主席2016年访问孟加拉国期间的见签项目，被誉为“一带一路”倡议下孟中印缅经济走廊“小而美”民生项目典范，是孟加拉国第一座现代化大型污水处理项目、南亚地区迄今为止最大的单体污水处理厂、孟加拉国第一个现代化污泥焚烧厂，服务达卡市500万人口，明显改善和提升了当地的生态环境。这是习近平生态文明思想在海外践行的生动典型实例，也是“一带一路”直接关系生态文明建设方面的典范工程，在孟加拉国当地具有十分重要的政治、经济和社会意义。

    尼泊尔上塔马克西水电站作为迄今为止尼泊尔政府投资最多、装机容量最大的水电站，堪称尼泊尔“国之荣耀”，被当地政府视为尼泊尔的“三峡工程”，极大缓解了尼泊尔用电短缺问题，对当地支柱产业发挥重要作用，同时也为尼泊尔提升全国电气化水平和工业用电、满足当地电力需求并出口多余电能提供了机遇，为尼泊尔实现绿色发展奠定了良好基础。

巴沙大坝是巴基斯坦全国上下翘首以盼的超级工程，大坝坝高272米，装机容量4500兆瓦，是目前巴基斯坦最大的水利枢纽工程，建成后将成为世界最高、规模最大的碾压混凝土坝，被誉为巴基斯坦的“三峡工程”，将在流域调节、灌溉、发电和供水上发挥重要作用。巴沙大坝项目刷新了电建集团牵头签约单体最大合同额的纪录。“中巴企业合作，共建国计民生工程”的新闻在当地各大平面和电视媒体的头版轮番报道，极大地提升了中国电建在巴品牌影响力，开启了又一个“中巴友谊”故事的新篇章。

以色列克卡夫哈亚邓抽水蓄能电站项目是中国公司在海外承建的第一个大型抽水蓄能电站，对于中国建筑企业海外抽蓄电站市场的开拓和技术积累具有里程碑式的意义，是中国电建抽水蓄能电站勘测、设计、施工、试运行等市场运作迈向全球布局的第一步，标志着抽水蓄能电站业务正式进入海外市场，将有力提升海外业务可持续发展的基础。

波黑伊沃维克风电项目是波黑首个以外商特许经营方式投资建设的能源项目，被列入2021年中国-中东欧国家领导人峰会成果清单，荣获波黑2022年度最佳外国投资者奖。项目高度契合“一带一路”倡议和“碳达峰、碳中和”目标，将进一步优化波黑电力结构，提升当地社会经济效益，有效改善周边环境，加强当地生态建设，推动能源转型，是“一带一路”倡议结出的丰硕果实。

建精品铸品牌  打造中国电建名片

欧亚区域地跨欧亚两大洲，各国别情况差异大、在建项目及中外员工数量多、安全形势复杂严峻，项目履约极富挑战性。十年来，欧亚区域总部全面贯彻落实中国电建国际业务“三步走”全球发展战略，以打造区域总部履约监管和风险防范中心为职责，逐步建立并完善了区域总部项目履约监管体系。集团27家成员企业在21个国家执行合同额大于500万美元的在建项目180多个，合同额超240多亿美元。涵盖了电力工程、水利建设、公路、铁路、机场、港口航道、房建、市政、水环境治理、矿业等多个行业领域。十年来，中国电建作为欧亚基建市场的主力军，充分发挥“水能砂城数”主业优势，以高质量管理实现高质量履约，建设了一大批“小而美”民生项目、“大而优”标志性精品工程，良好的履约能力获得了“一带一路”共建国政府、业主及民众的赞誉，在欧亚大陆上铸就了中国电建丰碑。

塞尔维亚贝尔格莱德绕城公路项目是中塞两国政府合作、“一带一路”倡议下的重点项目，是泛欧洲10号走廊的重要组成部分，也是中东欧区域第一个以人民币为支付工程款的项目，对于推动人民币作为国际货币在中东欧的国际化进程有着重要的意义。中国电建将我国成熟的移动模架施工技术加以改进并引进塞尔维亚，实现了“七天一跨”的惊人施工效率，桥梁工程比合同工期提前261天完工。助力塞尔维亚更好融入地区互联互通，对于塞尔维亚当地经济、交通发展具有重大意义。塞尔维亚总统武契奇对中国电建履约速度和工程质量给予高度肯定和赞扬，在开工典礼上说出了网络上流行一时的中国谚语“要想富，先修路”。

北马其顿米拉蒂诺维奇至斯蒂普高速公路项目是“中国-中东欧国家合作100亿美元专项贷款”的首批落地项目之一，是中国-中东欧双边互利互惠合作框架下的第一个大型基建项目，对中国与北马其顿双边关系起到了支撑作用，是欧洲交通网络的重要组成部分，在国家“16+1合作”中起着引领的作用。项目是中-北马合作共赢的成果，为深化两国合作起到积极作用，为北马创造大量就业机会，带动当地建材、专业施工队伍等相关行业发展。

孟加拉达卡轻轨6号线是孟加拉国政府大力发展新交通、积极完善城市轨道交通系统开工建设的第一条轻轨，轻轨线路长20.1公里，是当地民众极其期待的公共交通项目。该项目不仅为当地交通发展作出贡献、创造了经济价值，还大大改善了孟加拉国首都达卡的交通状况和城市环境，为当地民众带去了实实在在福祉。该项目的顺利通车，意味着孟加拉国正式迈入了电气化轨道交通时代，具有划时代的重要意义。

波兰E75奇热夫-比亚斯托韦克铁路项目的成功签约和实施，是中国电建近十年来深植当地市场、属地化经营的丰硕成果。作为泛欧铁路骨干网的重要组成部分，中欧班列的重要通道，具有重要的互联互通作用，设计时速为客运列车200公里，货运列车160公里，原有铁路平交系统全部改为立交系统，提高了列车通行效率，升级后的铁路将大大提高列车效率及交通安全性。

波兰弗罗茨瓦夫分洪河道整治工程使当地的抗洪能力从五十年一遇提升至百年一遇，给当地内河船运交通也带来了可观的经济效益。该工程是中国公司在欧盟基建市场顺利履约拿到TOC的第一个项目，树立了中国电建品牌形象。良好的履约得以在后续市场竞争中相继获得同一业主项下在奥德河的4个防洪项目，履约助力营销得到了较好诠释。该项目加深了中波两国合作与交流，为中国电建巩固与开发波兰乃至欧盟基建市场奠定了坚实的基础。城市运河段现在已成为当地新的旅游休闲景点，得到当地媒体和民众的称赞。

乌兹别克斯坦水电站修复项目，是首届“一带一路”国际合作高峰论坛中乌水电领域合作项下落实的第一个EPC项目。项目框架下三座水电站五台机组的并网发电缓解了乌兹别克斯坦首都塔什干及周边地区医院、市政、居民的供电压力，为当地政府战胜疫情注入了一针强心剂，也对提升电站盈利能力、发挥更大能源保障作用、促进乌兹别克斯坦经济建设实现可持续发展具有重要意义。项目的成功实施，对加强中乌能源领域合作，推动高质量共建“一带一路”发挥了重要作用。

哈萨克斯坦谢列克风电项目作为中国电建在中亚地区投资的首个新能源项目，设计、建造和施工均采用中国标准，是中哈高质量共建“一带一路”的标志性项目，被列入“中哈产能合作重点项目清单”，有效缓解哈萨克斯坦南部地区电力短缺、改善电力生产结构单一的状况，为助力哈萨克斯坦政府减碳目标的实现做出了贡献。

创建属地化平台  丝路同行共赢共享

十年来，欧亚区域坚持属地化发展，结合共建国政策、市场环境变化及区域总部的总体部署，按照“做实国别、一国一策”原则，以“机构属地化、决策属地化、经营属地化、资源属地化、资产属地化、责任属地化”为指导方向，重点在波兰、塞尔维亚、哈萨克斯坦、巴基斯坦、孟加拉国、尼泊尔等国别积极筹划和打造适合不同国别市场的属地化公司，培育属地化经营平台，稳步推进属地化建设。不同国别采用不同的属地化经营管控模式，享受当地政策红利，稳步开拓属地化国别及其周边国家市场，提高市场开发竞争力。目前在25个国别共设立了52个子公司、分公司、代表处。设立后的工作重点转移到加强属地化机构的市场开发力度，积极参与市场竞争，做实、做大、做强属地化机构。

同时，大力推进人才属地化，提供完整系统的培训机会，建立属地化员工学习交流机制，安排优秀外籍员工到北京总部进行学习和工作交流，创新开展和落实属地化建设，增强外籍员工对电建文化的认同感和对企业的忠诚度。在共建“一带一路”的路上，越来越多的海外员工和相关方真切地感受到了中国电建世界一流企业“自强不息、勇于超越”的企业精神，选择与中国电建同行，在成长中共赢。","关于我们

The once stricken vessel now looks as good as new having completed repairs at Fujian Huadong shipyard in China 10 days ahead of schedule.

The Dali arrived in arrived at the yard on 13 November last year and has now set sail (pictured above) after a successful repairs and overhaul.

The Singapore-registered Dali was on charter to Maersk at the time of the accident and managed by Synergy Marine in Singapore.

848,https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/10thi_e/10thi06_e.htm,"home the wto what is the wto? 10 things help countries develop
6 The WTO can ... help countries develop
Underlying the WTO’s trading system is the fact that more open trade can boost economic growth and help countries develop. In that sense, commerce and development are good for each other.

In addition, the WTO agreements are full of provisions that take into account the interests of developing countries.

The WTO can ...
...cut living costs and raise living standards
...settle disputes and reduce trade tensions
...stimulate economic growth and employment
...cut the cost of doing business internationally
...encourage good governance
...help countries develop
...give the weak a stronger voice
...support the environment and health
...contribute to peace and stability
...be effective without hitting the headlines

Over three-quarters of WTO members are developing or least-developed countries. All of those in the queue to join are likewise developing countries. Whether the interests of developing countries are well enough served in the WTO is a subject of continuing debate. But even the most critical developing countries acknowledge that the system offers them benefits.

In fact, few economists dispute that properly handled, trade is essential for development.

All WTO agreements contain special provisions for developing countries, including longer periods to implement agreements and commitments, measures to increase their trading opportunities and support to help them build the infrastructure for WTO work, handle disputes, and implement technical standards. Least-developed countries receive special treatment, including exemption from many provisions.

The needs of developing countries can also be used to justify actions that might not normally be allowed under the agreements – for example, governments giving certain subsidies.

And the negotiations and other work launched at the Doha Ministerial Conference in November 2001 include numerous issues that developing countries want to pursue.

Finally, although the WTO is not an aid agency, it does have a role to play, particularly as a forum and clearing house for information on trade-related development aid.

Aid for Trade. The debate over whether developing countries need aid or trade is at an end.

Today, there is widespread recognition that developing countries need both. But WTO agreements do not guarantee increased trade flows: they provide opportunities. Some countries are better placed than others to grasp those opportunities. Some need help: “Aid for Trade” and various other tools are aimed at enhancing the capacity of developing countries to participate more effectively in the global marketplace.

The WTO is the coordinating agency for the Aid for Trade programme and as such regularly brings donors, development agencies, recipient governments and the private sector together. This dialogue helps to highlight what is being provided and what is needed while encouraging the development of more suitably designed projects.

Both donor and recipient countries have responded to these efforts. Donor countries have committed an average of $40 billion a year to trade-related development programmes while recipient countries have had success

in pinpointing the specific areas where aid is needed and in mainstreaming trade into their development strategies.

Better communications. The WTO has set up reference centres in over 100 trade ministries and regional organizations in capitals of developing and least-developed countries, providing computers and internet access to enable ministry officials to keep abreast of events in the WTO in Geneva through online access to the WTO’s immense database of official documents and other material. Efforts are also being made to help countries that do not have permanent representatives in Geneva.","Click here to return to homepageWorld Trade OrganizationSkip to content

851,https://vercel.com/docs/ai-sdk,"AI SDK
The AI SDK is the TypeScript toolkit designed to help developers build AI-powered applications with Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Node.js, and more. Integrating LLMs into applications is complicated and heavily dependent on the specific model provider you use.

The AI SDK abstracts away the differences between model providers, eliminates boilerplate code for building chatbots, and allows you to go beyond text output to generate rich, interactive components.

Generating text
At the center of the AI SDK is AI SDK Core, which provides a unified API to call any LLM.

The following example shows how to generate text with the AI SDK using OpenAI's GPT-5:

import { generateText } from 'ai';
 
const { text } = await generateText({
  model: 'openai/gpt-5',
  prompt: 'Explain the concept of quantum entanglement.',
});
The unified interface means that you can easily switch between providers by changing just two lines of code. For example, to use Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 3.7:

import { generateText } from 'ai';
import { anthropic } from '@ai-sdk/anthropic';
 
const { text } = await generateText({
  model: anthropic('claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219'),
  prompt: 'How many people will live in the world in 2040?',
});
Generating structured data
While text generation can be useful, you might want to generate structured JSON data. For example, you might want to extract information from text, classify data, or generate synthetic data. AI SDK Core provides two functions (generateObject and streamObject) to generate structured data, allowing you to constrain model outputs to a specific schema.

The following example shows how to generate a type-safe recipe that conforms to a zod schema:

import { generateObject } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { z } from 'zod';
 
const { object } = await generateObject({
  model: 'openai/gpt-5',
  schema: z.object({
    recipe: z.object({
      name: z.string(),
      ingredients: z.array(z.object({ name: z.string(), amount: z.string() })),
      steps: z.array(z.string()),
    }),
  }),
  prompt: 'Generate a lasagna recipe.',
});
Using tools with the AI SDK
The AI SDK supports tool calling out of the box, allowing it to interact with external systems and perform discrete tasks. The following example shows how to use tool calling with the AI SDK:

import { generateText, tool } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
 
const { text } = await generateText({
  model: 'openai/gpt-5',
  prompt: 'What is the weather like today in San Francisco?',
  tools: {
    getWeather: tool({
      description: 'Get the weather in a location',
      inputSchema: z.object({
        location: z.string().describe('The location to get the weather for'),
      }),
      execute: async ({ location }) => ({
        location,
        temperature: 72 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 21) - 10,
      }),
    }),
  },
});
Getting started with the AI SDK
The AI SDK is available as a package. To install it, run the following command:

pnpm
yarn
npm
bun
pnpm i ai
See the AI SDK Getting Started guide for more information on how to get started with the AI SDK.

GST Registration – How To Register, Types, Exemptions & Eligibility
The GST, or Goods and Services Tax, is an indirect tax on the sale of goods and services. Since its implementation on July 1, 2017, it has effectively reduced other indirect taxes levied on goods and services. Manufacturers, Service Providers, Retailers, and Consumers must only pay GST from their respective ends instead of VAT, excise duty, service tax, and other taxes. This article explains how to register for GST online, which is required for any company with annual revenue of more than 20,00,000 INR.

What is GST registration?
Every business with annual revenue of 20,00,000 INR or more is required to register for GST. The process is entirely online, and it must be completed through the GST portal on the Indian government’s website. Upon registration, firms are assigned a unique 15-digit GSTIN registration number based on their PAN and state of registration. This unique number can be used to apply for refunds and loans. It also facilitates the verification procedure.
The Goods and Service Tax website allows you to verify your GSTIN online.

How to complete the GST registration process online?
The following is online GST registration process step by step breakdown:

Visit the GST portal. Click on ‘Service’ and then ‘New Registration’ under the ‘Registration’ Tab.
Fill in the information about your company. You must enter your company’s PAN number as well as the legal name of your firm as it appears on your PAN card. OTPs will be sent to the supplied email address and phone number. When you’re finished, click ‘Proceed.’
Input the two OTPs you got in the previous step. If you don’t get the OTP, click the ‘Resend OTP’ button. After you’ve entered your OTPs, click the ‘Continue’ button.
A 15-digit Temporary Reference Number will be assigned to you (TRN). It will also be sent to the registered phone number and email address. Make a note of it.
Step 1 is repeated, but instead of clicking on ‘New Registration,’ click on ‘Temporary Reference Number’ under the ‘Registration’ Tab.
Enter the Temporary Reference Number (TRN) you were given. Complete the captcha and click the ‘Proceed’ button.
Another OTP will be sent to your registered phone number and email. Click on ‘Proceed’ after entering the OTP.
Your application will appear as a draft. Click on the Edit icon.
The second part of registration starts. You need to complete this within 15 days of completion of Step 4. You will need the following documents in this part:","Turtlemint Insurance

How To Pass The Vibe Check: 7 Tips For Marketing to Gen Zs
So, you’re looking for ways to target Gen Z-ers, but don’t know how? 

Or maybe you’ve tried, but just can’t seem to make them tick. For those of you who think all that’s required is chucking in a few slang words here and there, you’re sorely mistaken. Gen Z-ers grew up with technology and the world of digital, so they’re arguably the most clued-in when it comes to online persuasion techniques.

Do you know what that means?

You’re going to have to try a little bit harder and think more creatively to convince them that your product or service is worth it. 

Today’s your lucky day; because as a member of Gen Z myself, I’ve got the inside scoop on what will boost your chances of appealing to Gen Z-ers. 

Get comfortable, and let’s dive right in, shall we?

Gen Z Marketing Checklist
The last thing we want to do is make your head spin with overwhelming information, so we’ve put together a checklist of some ideas and tactics to incorporate into your Gen Z marketing strategy. You’re welcome, by the way!

1. Be Authentic and Transparent
teenage girl 

Gen Z is all about that authenticity and transparency. They can sniff out fakers from a mile away, and they won’t hesitate to call you out on it. So, be real with them. Use your social media channels to give them a behind-the-scenes look at your brand, show them the faces behind the products, and let them in on your brand values. When you’re transparent and authentic, you build trust with your Gen Z audience, which is essential to building brand loyalty.

Don’t believe us? Read about the latest de-influencing trend on TikTok in our blog, which highlights how users are becoming increasingly cynical about influencer marketing and the products that influencers promote on social media.

2. Use Social Media Strategically
 

social media

Speaking of social media, it’s the go-to platform for Gen Z consumers who spend hours scrolling through Instagram, TikTok, Facebook and more. To effectively market to Gen Z, you need to be where they are. 

But, it’s not just about being on social media; it’s about using it strategically. Make sure your content is visually appealing, and use humour and maybe the occasional meme to connect with your audience. Just make sure your content aligns with your brand values and resonates with your audience.","First Page - Digital Marketing Agency Australia

信息来源：   时间： 2021-11-09    作者：戚诚伟（银行业务研究委员会，北京天驰君泰律师事务所上海分所）
   一、概述

（一）最高额抵押定义

  最高额抵押在民法典第420条规定中进行了定义，是指“为担保债务的履行，债务人或者第三人对一定期间内将要连续发生的债权提供担保财产的，债务人不履行到期债务或者发生当事人约定的实现抵押权的情形，抵押权人有权在最高债权额限度内就该担保财产优先受偿。最高额抵押权设立前已经存在的债权，经当事人同意，可以转入最高额抵押担保的债权范围。”

（二）最高额抵押特征

  最高额抵押区别于一般抵押权主要特点如下：

  第一，最高额抵押担保债权具有不特定性。最高额抵押权所担保债权的不特定性具体体现在两个方面：一是，最高额抵押权担保的债权一般情况下并非是特定既存的债权，而是未来的债权，最高额抵押权设立时，其所担保的债权并没有实际存在；二是，最高额抵押权所担保的债权的发生具有连续性，只有在特定的情形及时点才会确定下来。相比之下，在一般抵押担保中，抵押人只是针对某一特定债权向债权人提供抵押，债权金额是确定的。

  第二，最高额抵押权有最高债权限度。最高额抵押权所担保的债权具有不特定性，但担保物的价值相对确定，即抵押权人基于最高额抵押权可以优先受偿的债权的最高限额，实际发生的债权可优先受偿的范围也以该限额为限，这也是区别于一般抵押权最重要的一个特征。比如：在最高额抵押担保中，在价值人民币1亿元不动产上设立抵押最高债权限额人民币1亿元，即便今后该不动产价值上升至人民币2亿元，最高额抵押权人仍只能在人民币1亿元范围内优先受偿。而在一般抵押担保中，抵押人是将该不动产的全部价值作为担保，无论该抵押不动产是否大幅升值，一般抵押权人均有权就该不动产全部变现价值人民币2亿元主张优先受偿。

  第三，最高额抵押权是从属性原则缓和的产物。最高额抵押权是特殊的抵押权，其特殊之处在于可以担保将来一定期间内将要连续发生的债权，无需再每一个债权上设立一个担保物权，常见于银行授信、经销关系等连续的交易往来中，最高额抵押的方式可以简化手续，减少交易成本，进而加速资金的融通，促进经济的发展。

（三）最高债权额的含义

  民法典第420条规定“抵押权人有权在最高债权额限度内就该担保财产优先受偿”中“最高债权额限度”含义在以往理论界和司法实践中一直有争议，主要集中在“债权最高限额”和“本金最高限额”两种观点。“债权最高限额”的观点认为，最高债权额包括本金、利息、违约金、损害赔偿金、保管担保财产的费用、实现债权的费用在内的所有债权累加可以优先受偿的限额；而“本金最高限额”则是对本金的最高限额，只是限制本金不超过最高限额，至于利息、违约金、损害赔偿金、保管担保财产的费用、实现债权的费用等则是依据担保的费用确定，不受这一限额的限制，仍然可以列入优先受偿的范围。[1]正式为了解决这个争议《民法典担保制度司法解释》第15条进行了明确规定，即“最高额担保中的最高债权额”，是指包括主债权及其利息、违约金、损害赔偿金、保管担保财产的费用、实现债权或者实现担保物权的费用等在内的全部债权，但是当事人另有约定的除外。登记的最高债权额与当事人约定的最高债权额不一致的，人民法院应当依据登记的最高债权额确定债权人优先受偿的范围。”根据上述法律和司法解释规定可知，第一，最高债权额是“债权最高限额”的含义并不仅指债权本金，还可以包括利息、损害赔偿金、违约金及实现债权的费用等；第二，至于优先受偿的范围应当以登记为准，因此抵押权人主张抵押权担保范围的优先权应当以登记为准而不是抵押担保合同的约定。如此一来可以彻底解决存在司法实践中的争议。

  事实上，在《民法典担保制度》上述规定之前，最高院在《九民纪要》第58条中对“最高债权限额”进行了比较全面规范，具体而言：首先，最高院明确，“以登记作为公示方式的不动产担保物权的担保范围，一般应当以登记的范围为准。”这个与《民法典司法解释》第15条规定是一致的。其次，最高院认为，我国目前不动产担保物权登记，不同地区的系统设置及登记规则并不一致，人民法院在审理案件时应当充分注意制度设计上的差别，作出符合实际的判断：一是多数省区市的登记系统未设置“担保范围”栏目，仅有“被担保主债权数额（最高债权数额）”的表述，且只能填写固定数字。而当事人在合同中又往往约定担保物权的担保范围包括主债权及其利息、违约金等附属债权，致使合同约定的担保范围与登记不一致。显然，这种不一致是由于该地区登记系统设置及登记规则造成的该地区的普遍现象。人民法院以合同约定认定担保物权的担保范围，是符合实际的妥当选择。可见，限于登记机构技术所限造成只能登机主债权本金登记为最高债权数额并不是抵押权人与抵押人真实意愿，所以应当按照双方抵押担保合同违约为准。最后，最高院强调，一些省区市不动产登记系统设置与登记规则比较规范，担保物权登记范围与合同约定一致在该地区是常态或者普遍现象，人民法院在审理案件时，应当以登记的担保范围为准。

  目前，随着民法典及《民法典担保制度司法解释》的正式实施，据笔者所知在包括上海在内各地登记机构已经允许当事人办理抵押登记时可以将抵押担保范围进行详细的登记，所以未来对于最高债权额对应优先权的金额均以登记为准，彻底解决这个因技术问题产生的争议。

  二、最高额抵押所担保债权确定问题

（一）概述

  最高额抵押对应担保债权不特定性的特征决定其实现首要前提是必须使这种不特定的债权特定化和具体化，只有这样才能明确抵押权人对抵押财产的优先受偿范围从而实现抵押权。所以，在原《物权法》中第206条对最高额抵押权担保债权确定进行了规定，即“有下列情形之一的，抵押权人的债权确定：（1）约定的债权确定期间届满；（2）没有约定债权确定期间或者约定不明确，抵押权人或者抵押人自最高额抵押权设立之日起满二年后请求确定债权；（3）新的债权不可能发生；（4）抵押财产被查封、扣押；（5）债务人、抵押人被宣告破产或者被撤销；（6）法律规定债权确定的其他情形。”

  另外，根据《物权法》的上述规定在《最高人民法院关于人民法院民事执行中查封、扣押、冻结财产的规定（2020修正）》第25条进一步明确规定：“人民法院查封、扣押被执行人设定最高额抵押权的抵押物的，应当通知抵押权人。抵押权人受抵押担保的债权数额自收到人民法院通知时起不再增加。人民法院虽然没有通知抵押权人，但有证据证明抵押权人知道或者应当知道查封、扣押事实的，受抵押担保的债权数额从其知道或者应当知道该事实时起不再增加。”

  结合上述原《物权法》和司法解释规定，在民法典第423条进行了综合规定：“抵押权人的债权确定事由如下：（1）约定的债权确定期间届满；（2）没有约定债权确定期间或者约定不明确，抵押权人或者抵押人自最高额抵押权设立之日起满二年后请求确定债权；（3）新的债权不可能发生；（4）抵押权人知道或者应当知道抵押财产被查封、扣押；（5）债务人、抵押人被宣告破产或者解散；（6）法律规定债权确定的其他情形。”

  根据上述法律和司法解释规定，银行及金融机构在通过最高额抵押进行授信后，务必在新增贷款时需要查询抵押物","

Non, la mise en œuvre de l’article L. 600-5 du Code de l’urbanisme n’est pas subordonnée à la divisibilité des constructions autorisées par un permis de construire illégal !


Par Arnaud Barthélémy

Publié le 2 novembre 2015

Par une décision rendue le 1er octobre 2015, le Conseil d’État vient de préciser les conditions d’application, par le juge administratif, du mécanisme de régularisation du permis de construire que prévoit l’article L. 600-5 du Code de l’urbanisme. Si l’occasion n’est pas tout à fait nouvelle, il s’agit cependant de la première fois que la haute juridiction administrative se prononce dans le cadre de la nouvelle rédaction de cet article telle qu’issue de l’ordonnance du 18 juillet 2013 relative aux contentieux de l’urbanisme. L’opportunité se présente donc de faire le point sur la mise en œuvre, quelque peu laborieuse, des dispositions de l’article L. 600-5 du Code de l’urbanisme par le juge administratif.

En l’espèce, le maire de Toulouse avait autorisé la construction d’un ensemble de logements sur le territoire de sa commune. À la suite d’un recours gracieux demeuré infructueux, plusieurs riverains du projet avaient cependant saisi le juge administratif aux fins d’obtenir l’annulation de ce permis de construire au motif que celui-ci méconnaissait les dispositions du plan local d’urbanisme (PLU) de la commune relatives à l’implantation des constructions par rapport aux limites séparatives. Le tribunal administratif de Toulouse fit droit à leur demande en annulant le permis de construire…

Hello, my friends. It’s been a long week down here in Sydney since we last met across this virtual boardroom table seven days ago. And quite frankly, I went into this week’s merch search needing something to lift my spirits, and there was the Mary Blair Alice in Wonderland collection. Let me show you.



Alice in Wonderland by Mary Blair

Fractional ownership firm Stake will pursue property deals worth 1 billion riyals ($266 million) in Saudi Arabia over the next six months, to tap into rising interest from foreign investors looking to enter a market that’s been largely closed to outsiders.

The Dubai-based digital platform is already in the process of acquiring a fully-rented mall in Riyadh for 187 million riyals and plans to buy a residential tower with more than 140 apartments for 200 million riyals, its co-founder Rami Tabbara said in an interview.

After nearly two decades in Fortune 500 CPG innovation, I’ve seen numerous shiny new methods come and go, all in the drive to create a competitive edge—gamified consumer research, consumer insight marketplaces, and asynchronous methodologies to name a few. Some stuck, some didn’t.


AI tools are the latest disruptive force in consumer research, promising and delivering significant analytic and time savings. We’ve tested bad AI tools, good AI tools, and even great AI tools. But what truly blows us away? AI tools are helping us augment our approach, speed up the innovation process, and deliver innovation insights to our clients faster than ever. The right AI tools don’t just assist—they can enhance and accelerate everything we do.

AI is a powerful research partner

While everyone’s talking about generative AI, don’t underestimate the value of natural language processing (NLP). At Mission Field, we’ve seen NLP unlock insights from massive amounts of consumer data in days, rather than weeks. No matter how hard we try to be impartial, we all have blind spots which can result in missing things when we do our own analysis of qualitative information. NLP tools provide a valuable service by avoiding those internal blocks we may not be aware we have.

How CoreWeave Bought and Borrowed Its Way to AI Domination

Combining NLP with human expertise creates a powerful feedback loop: The technology identifies patterns, allowing human researchers to dig deeper leading to faster, sharper insights. With NLP we can process 10 times more open-ended consumer responses in the same time frame—without sacrificing quality.

AI tools aren’t flawless, but the more we use them, the more opportunities we find to accelerate or streamline our work. For example, we’ve applied AI to speed up our own process and seen firsthand how it transforms work. A client wanted to accelerate their product development; AI let us cut a 3-month timeline down to 4-5 weeks.

Another example? Ethnography work that used to take 4-6 weeks—recruiting, discussion guide creation, interviews, synthesis—can now be done at scale with AI. Fifty consumer ethnographies can be video-recorded, analyzed, and summarized in 8 hours. Not every insight is a home run, but enough are game-changing to make it worth using. Then we can focus our time on the most important parts of the analysis.


Human expertise maximizes AI

You might be wondering: Isn’t AI risky? You don’t want competitors potentially accessing your data, research, and methodologies. Let me be clear: It would be a mistake not to embrace AI because of those risks, especially when you can easily take steps to safeguard sensitive research data and proprietary innovations while using AI tools.

At Mission Field, we mitigate these risks by stripping all client identifiers, pseudonymizing product categories and features, and removing proprietary methodologies before any information enters an AI tool. We also use closed loop tools that do not put our clients’ IP into the public domain. Leverage AI’s power without exposing what makes you competitive.","SUBSCRIBE

Business NewsBy Member SubmissionApril 10, 20256850
Share:

Springfield Utility Board (SUB) has received national recognition for excellence in two critical areas of electric service—reliability and employee safety. The American Public Power Association (APPA) recently honored SUB with a pair of prestigious awards that reflect the utility’s commitment to keeping the power on and its employees safe.

Recognition for exceptional electric reliability in 2024 is based on data collected through APPA’s eReliability Tracker service. The tool allows utilities to track power outage and restoration data, which is then compared annually to national statistics from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

“We are proud to receive this recognition,” said Sanjeev King, Director of Electrical Engineering and Operations at SUB. “The greatest asset SUB’s electric division has is a dedicated, experienced workforce, and I’m impressed every day at their commitment to serving Springfield.”

“Year after year, data consistently demonstrate public power utilities provide highly reliable service,” said Paul Zummo, APPA Director of Research and Development. “The utilities recognized here are truly elite when it comes to keeping the lights on.”

In addition to reliability, SUB earned a 2024 APPA Safety Award of Excellence, which recognizes utilities with the lowest incidence rates of work-related injuries and a strong safety culture. More than 200 utilities across the country entered the annual awards, with SUB earning the top “diamond” designation.

“Safety isn’t a box we check, it’s a mindset that’s embedded in everything we do. Our employees work in high-risk conditions every day to serve our customers and community, and this award reflects their discipline and vigilance to the work and each other.”

– Nicole Dalke, Human Resources Manager, Springfield Utility Board

Jon Beasley, Chair of APPA’s Safety Committee, added, “This award honors utilities that hold fast to safety practices and – in doing so – puts the safety of their personnel and their customers above all else.”

APPA represents more than 2,000 not-for-profit, community-owned electric utilities across the country and has conducted the Safety Awards annually for more than 66 years.

“These awards reflect what matters most to us: serving our community with care and excellence,” said SUB General Manager Jeff Nelson. “We are proud to be recognized nationally for doing the work our customers count on every day—safely and reliably.”

Decade by decade, slice by slice, take an in-depth look at the history of Lou Malnati’s Pizzeria, serving Chicago's best deep dish pizza since 1971.

Lou Malnati's Today

1970s
On March 17th, 1971, Lou Malnati and his wife Jean opened the first Lou Malnati’s Pizzeria in Lincolnwood, IL. Lou always thought it was funny that an Italian should open a pizzeria in a Jewish neighborhood on an Irish holiday, but that was just Lou’s style. He wanted his restaurant to be a model of hospitality, a place dedicated to family.

Malnati Family on opening dayOpening day 1971 was a day to remember, not only because hungry customers were getting their first taste of Lou’s soon to be legendary deep dish pizza, but because a car crashed through the walls of the main dining room during the dinner hour. Looking back on it, Jean says this incident made for an “exciting” opening day, but like with all things, the Malnatis bounced back.

After meeting with enormous success in Lincolnwood, Lou decided it was time to expand the business, and he opened another pizzeria in Elk Grove Village, close to Chicago’s O’Hare Airport. Unfortunately, a road construction project began just a few months after the opening, and the next 14 months nearly put Lou Malnati’s Pizzeria out of business. Lou refused to give up, and as soon as construction finished, the customers came back in droves.

The Malnatis were not so fortunate when they opened their third pizzeria in south suburban Flossmoor in 1977, just a year before Lou died. The logistical nightmare of opening a location over 50 miles from where Lou had created his ""hub"" in the north suburbs almost bankrupted the family. Just 16 months after opening, they were forced to close this pizzeria, and were left owing hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Somehow, Lou's indomitable spirit lived on, as his son, Marc, graduated from college and joined Jean. In the Malnati tradition, they steadied the ship and paid back their vendors over the next few years.","Locations & Menus

Calling all Jupiter Cats out there! :heart_eyes_cat: :pray: Who wouldn’t love to sharpen their claws on some Jupiter trivia?

Jeopardy Cat
Jeopardy Cat
768×734 132 KB
My next proposal wants to outline a fun and educational initiative: a monthly Jupiter Quiz Competition! called JUP K.A.R.E. (Knowledge And Rewards Earning)

The Goal:

Educate: Deepen our understanding of Jupiter products, functionalities, and activities.
Engage: Foster the PPP attitude and spirit through friendly and fun competition.
Reward: Incentivize active participation with $JUP prizes or even some kind of jup merch at the beginning - there’s gotta be some sort of a snack for our hungry tummies :joy:
How it should Work:

Platform: We could utilize a Discord QuizBot (similar to Kamino Finance).
Frequency: Hold at least 2 quizzes per month.
Format:
10-15 multiple-choice questions per round.
20-25 seconds to answer each question by thicking the correct checkboxes
Real-time leaderboards to track progress.
A dedicated CAT mod to energize the competition with fun facts and humor.
“The quiz should be available in a specific timeframe, at least 3-4 days to reach as many cats as posible!” @JD-SOL84 's idea
“Offer at least 3 days before the quiz is avilable a lesson/study guideline about the items within the Jupiverse that would be included on that quiz.” also @JD-SOL84 's idea, btw J.D. hope ur OK with me adding this :smiley:
The Prize Pool:

Source:
Utilize some of the unclaimed $JUP tokens from the first ASR session (exploring this as a first option fosters sustainability).
Alternatively, consider sourcing from project funds if necessary - maybe community wallet?..even though using ASR leftovers would be a better idea from my POV.
If would be jup merch, then we need some talented cats that can provide the merch with the help of the team.
Total Prize / quiz sesh: $500 worth of $JUP tokens (approximately $400-450 USD at current price). We could have an entire year of quizz sessions, like 24 of them.
Distribution:
Top 10 winners on the leaderboard receive a portion of the prize pool.
Graduated rewards from 1st place (150 $JUP) to 10th place (15 $JUP).
Winners claim prizes through a ticketing system like the existing “general-ticket” channel.
Boosting Engagement:

Points System: Award points for correct answers and quick responses.
Bonus Points: Consider bonus points for the fastest answers to add an extra layer of excitement.
Multiple Correct Answers: Award bonus points to users who correctly identify all correct answers for questions with multiple options.
Staking Incentive for Top Winners(This one would be sick :smiley: ): “Stake it till you make it!” To further incentivize long-term investment in Jupiter and support the project’s growth, I propose the following: winners from the top 10 who choose to stake their $JUP prizes will receive a bonus of 50% of their winnings. For example, a winner who earns 100 $JUP can effectively stake 150 $JUP by participating in this incentive. This will encourage more $JUP to be locked up, by same 30 days rule for unlocking…another way to contribute to the project’s long-term health and security while aligning winners’ interests with the project’s success.
Benefits for Jupiter:

【丙子日柱】 一柱论命
丙子日主的人命运分析
<a href=http://www.sf280.com/bazililun/yizhulunming/126.html target=_blank class=infotextkey>丙子</a>
1、丙火日元坐支子水。从方位上看，是临于北方，从五行十二宫看，则临于胎地。之所以把丙火临于子视为胎地。是因为就十二个月看，子为干支历的十一月。而在此之前的亥月，作为火之母的木五行已经进气，而子月，更是在冬至起一阳来复的时候。因此，这时的丙火就如鸡蛋里的蛋黄，婴儿之在母体，处于胎养的过程中。当然，从子月或子时看，丙火仍然孱弱，但若从长远看，却又有越行越旺的前途。这也就是我们常说，丙子日出生的人，一般说来，其命运会越走越好的原因。
2、从《滴天髓》说的“水猖显节”看，丙子日出生的男女，都有好的身材。不是具有优秀的形体美，就是具有难以言说的气质美。因此，丙子日出生的人，不管男女，都会受到异性的追捧。
3、丙子日出生的男人，虽然具有帅哥的形体或气质，也能受到女人的追捧。但却不能就此断定丙子日出生的男人就能娶到自己满意的妻子。一是妻宫子水尅制丙火，二是丙火“逢辛反怯”。因此，我们又可以大胆断定，丙子日出生的男人，虽然在现实生活中有很多追捧自己的女子可供自己挑选，但最终到手的姻缘，却很难使自己幸福满意，因此，也就很难长相厮守到白头。因为命书把子、午、卯、酉视为四败之地，所以，也就有很多命理学家认为丙子日出生的人是自坐桃花，所以容易招蜂引蝶。但是我们若从另一个角度去看，子水为丙火正官，如此，我们也可以把这看成是官带桃花，也就是说，丙子日出生的男人，虽然会感到姻缘不幸福美满，但却不得不承认自己的妻子有为人有正义感的一面。而作为丙子日出生的男人本人，也是品行端正，能得众人信任之人，因此，从一生来看，会有意外的福气，逐渐发达。
4、丙子日出生的女人。从干支组合关系看，为夫星夫位，应当说，虽然也容易招异性追捧，但自身却也品行端正，而且得到的丈夫，也是品行端正之人。但因为，子和申，和辰有三合水局的五行机缘，所以，自己的感情世界，也就常常会被众多追随者困扰。其运气也就吉凶参半。丙子日出生的女人，由于身处胎地，所以，对人生也就颇多幻想。想法多，自然用脑也就多，子中癸水有激活丁火之机，所以话也就多。因此丙子日出生的女人，容易给人喜欢唠叨之嫌。还要防轻微的脑部神经病痛。
5、丙子日出生的人，不管男女，都有自尊心极强，很任性，希望贯彻自己的意志，富于行动力，有力行心，对前途很有信心，而且还会很有钱。但，这钱财多来于传统，来于常规收入，若贪图走捷径，一夜暴富，则往往会血本无归。
6、丙子日出生的人，不管男女，在命局中若出现子午冲或岁运逢午火来冲，按中医的说法，是少阴经被引动，在生理上则要注意预防血症，腹鸣、胀满、痉挛、疝气、癌症、血压异常，以及由于抵抗力不足，心肾不交，睡眠不好。

丙子日出生时辰的八字命运
丙子日戊子时生，生于寅月或己卯未月，木能生火，故尤为尊贵。生于冬季，丙火气息微弱，贫困短命。生于戌月，且行火运土运，官至五六品。可怕的是，生于丁巳月，短命；生于己酉月，败散家产，自身低贱。
丙子日己丑时生，年月支是寅亥申辰，天干透出财星、印绶、食神的，显贵。
丙子日庚寅时生，生于子月，官至近侍。癸酉月，且行水运或木运，清高尊贵；行火运或木运，官至五六品以上。年月支是未申，或年月柱是癸午，身居武职，十分显贵。但寿命不长。
丙子日辛卯时生，子卯相刑，伤妻害子。如果年柱和月柱相同，主科举第一名，官至近侍。年月支为寅午丑戌，干支都有合，大贵。
丙子日壬辰时生，生于辰月或戌丑未月，偏官受到克制，吉利。年月支是亥卯，富贵双全。生于寅月或午月，行子运，生于子月，行寅午运，皆主尊贵。否则，不是做和尚，就是当道士。
丙子日癸巳时生，丙禄在巳，癸禄在子，因此做互换禄马论，在年月中没有壬己寅亥冲破，官至郎中或御史，位至公侯。
丙子日甲午时生，生于春季，吉利。生于夏季，没有依靠。生于秋季，财旺。生于冬季，是贵人命，但得子较晚。行火运或土运，方能兴旺发达。
丙子日乙未时生，生于春季，印绶稳重；生于夏天，比较安稳；生于秋天，适得其反；生于冬季，显贵，在岁运中也一样。
丙子日丙申时生，如果月通火气，或生寅月、卯月，再行身旺运，吉利。年月柱布满金，应以弃命从财格论，也做好命论。
丙子日丁酉时生，生于春季，安稳，夏季贵显，秋季一般，冬季吉利。年月支是未申酉亥，十分尊贵。柱中有丑和子合局，或有辰和酉合局，都是贵人命。
丙子日戊戌时生，是长寿之命，且名利双收。生于寅月或亥卯未月，或年月支是申酉戌巳，皆主贵显。
丙子日己亥时生，生于秋季，是平常之命。生于未月，又行水木运，天干透出木火的，显贵。生于子月，且行东方运，命主大贵。年月的干支是申、亥、丑、戌的，命主也显贵。

The Science of Bacteria and Fungi
For years veterinarians, clinicians, and scientists have been studying the microorganisms that live on the skin and in the ears of dogs. These microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi, are usually referred to as the ‘microbiota’ [1]. This microbiota can influence the dog’s health by providing a barrier against pathogens, preventing hypersensitization to environmental allergens, and interacting with the host cells to impact cellular function and immunity [1,2]. We know there is a large variety of microorganisms living on your dog that differ by location on the body and by individual [2,3].

Only with the help of Next-Generation Sequencing technology can we really reveal just how diverse this microbiota is, and how it can contribute to canine skin and ear well-being. For example, an imbalance in the bacterial composition and a reduction of bacterial diversity of the skin is often associated with atopic dermatitis [3-5]. The skin of these dogs tends to show higher abundance of Staphylococcus sp. and Corynebacterium sp. [4]. Staphylococcus also tends to be higher on skin of dogs with allergen-induced atopic dermatitis [6]. It is quite important to identify and understand these dog–bacteria interactions because these skin microbes may not only invade and infect the skin but can also contribute to the inflammatory response [7].

When we sequence the DNA of all the bacteria and fungi that are present in a patient’s sample, we can directly identify potential pathogens, assess the microbial diversity, and compare the patient’s sample with those of healthy dogs as controls. An example is shown in figure 2 (to the right) where there is a striking difference between the healthy sample on the top, and the diseased skin sample on the bottom.

Scientific research reveals shifting the abundance of specific bacterial and fungal species can contribute to diseases. Assessing the skin and ear microbiota as a clinical tool can assist by providing the necessary information for detecting susceptibility, providing diagnosis, and aiding the timely treatment of dermatological canine diseases. MiDOG® is now making this technology available to veterinarians.

Die besten Motorrad-Racing-Handschuhe im Vergleich.

Fachbereich: Motorradbekleidung
Redakteur: Stuart S.
Wer schon mal im Winter ohne Handschuhe Motorrad gefahren ist, der weiß: Spaß macht das nicht. Deswegen trägt man Motorradhandschuhe: Sie schützen vor Kälte, außerdem bieten Sie Schutz bei potentiellen Unfällen.

So werden Ober- und Unterhand je nach Modell durch Knöchelschutz, Schaumpolster oder Kevlareinsätze geschützt. Besonders robuste Handschuhe halten besser warm, sind dafür aber weniger beweglich. Dünne Handschuhe aus Mesh oder Textil sind zwar beweglich, halten aber kaum warm. Finden Sie mit unserer Test- bzw. Vergleichstabelle die besten Motorradhandschuhe für Ihre Bedürfnisse! Überzeugt hat uns hier im Oktober 2025 besonders das Modell Kemimoto 701* mit seinen Eigenschaften.

A liquidity pool is an Aave market instance that enables users to participate as suppliers or borrowers. Governance-approved parameters, such as reserve configurations and collateralization thresholds, define each pool. Suppliers provide liquidity into the pool that borrowers can access through overcollateralised positions. In return, suppliers earn interest, while borrowers can obtain liquidity against their collateral, all facilitated through decentralised smart contracts.

Aave liquidity pools operate on a blockchain network governed by decisions that define the chain and reserve parameters. Parameter decisions must balance liquidity demands for various actions with risk management. The use of smart contracts validate parameters, executing the actions of borrowing, repaying, and liquidation processes seamlessly without intermediaries. This decentralised approach enhances the transparency, efficiency, and security of financial interactions within the pool.

The core actions that can be taken on the liquidity pool are:

Supply
Suppliers
Liquidity Pools
Supplying tokens to the Aave Protocol allows users to earn interest on their digital assets and utilise supplied tokens as collateral. When tokens are supplied, they are transferred to the Aave liquidity pool, a system of smart contracts that facilitates overcollateralised borrowing of tokens. In Aave, supplied tokens automatically accrue interest based on the current market supply rate. As the balance of supplied tokens increases, interest is accrued dynamically, reflecting the current rate allocated to suppliers.

Interest rates for supplied tokens are determined by the borrow utilisation rate, which measures the proportion of assets currently borrowed against the total supplied in the pool, and by governance parameters that can be adjusted through community decisions. These parameters, including collateralisation requirements and interest rates for suppliers and borrowers, are influenced by onchain inputs such as token balances, oracle prices, and the borrow utilisation ratio. As liquidity is supplied, borrowed, repaid, or withdrawn from the pool, the interest rates are updated accordingly.

Withdraw
Suppliers
Liquidity Pools
Aave Protocol allows suppliers to withdraw their supplied tokens, including accrued interest, as long as there is sufficient unborrowed liquidity in the reserve. The withdrawal amount is limited by the available underlying assets, and that the user’s ability to maintain a sufficient collateral ratio for their borrow position. Periphery contracts with features such as withdraw and switch, allow users to redeem their supplied liquidity in a different token, providing more options for efficient asset management.

When withdrawing with an active borrow position, it’s crucial to maintain a healthy collateralisation ratio to avoid liquidation. Reducing collateral can lower the health factor, increasing the risk of liquidation. To remain safe, after the withdrawal, the account must stay above the liquidation threshold parameters. Therefore, withdrawals require careful management and consideration of the overall borrow positions to avoid liquidation.","Documentation

I’m Not That Old, Why Do My Knees Hurt So Much?
(WellnessPursuits.com) We know that an active lifestyle is the foundation of cardiovascular health, weight control, and mental acuity, but it can take a real toll on your knees.

We often forget that the benefits of strenuous exercise often come with the price of structural pain.  Your blood pressure can be ideal, your weight can be optimal, but you can find yourself quickly crippled if you live by the mantra “no pain, no gain.”



We’re able to move around with the help of a complex system of levers, pulleys, and weights (bones, ligaments, muscles). But our upright posture means serious  stress on the joints.  We don’t usually think about them until something goes wrong.


“The mere act of walking puts 150% of your body weight on the joint, its ligaments and tendons.”

A set of tennis, a short jog, or day of gardening even puts enormous stress on your knees.  Only four short ligaments hold your knee together, and when those ligaments break down, you’re going to know it. The key to avoiding serious immobility is what you do after you feel the warning signs.



There’s a reason that your neighborhood sporting goods store offers a full line of knee wraps and ice packs: knee pain.

Knee pain comes in a variety of symptoms, and none of them are any fun. If you have transient, off-and-on pain, a dull ache, a stabbing pain, or a sensation of instability or popping, your body is sending you the proverbial message: “Give it a rest… or we’ll just quit.”

So here’s the message: If you don’t treat your knees with great care, they can turn your entire once healthy body into an immovable mass at any age.

Your knee is a vital part of your anatomy. In fact, your overall health and mobility can literally depend upon its function, so if it hurts:

1. Don’t just shrug it off and ignore it.

2. Any pain in your knee during movement is a warning that something is amiss.

If after ice, wraps and rest, it still hurts, don’t ignore it. You cannot just jump back into your regular routine without putting your knees at serious risk.


3. The key is to start back very slowly and see if you can rehabilitate them yourself.

Use this list to help with rehabilitation:

Glucosamine, chondroitin and collagen supplements can help speed up healing. Bone broth is also considered one of the best joint lubricants you can add to your diet.
Any bending exercise you do should be slow and controlled by holding onto something solid at the same time. Start with a knee wrap and do not proceed if it hurts.
If your knee continues to feel unstable and hurts after a couple of weeks of taking it easy, it’s time to see your doctor.

Loss of Service on Scheduled Porting Date
Loss of Service on Scheduled Porting Date
Updated: 03/27/2025
Symptom
Your telephone number has lost service on the date it is scheduled to transfer to 8x8.
Applies To
Porting
Number Transfer
Loss of Service
Resolution
Number transfer (porting) involves multiple parties and requires your telephone numbers to be added to their new network and platform, whilst being removed from the previous systems. During this process, it is normal for your telephone numbers to experience up to 15 minutes of downtime on the day of your port.
If your telephone numbers lose service for more than 15 minutes follow the steps below.  
Step 1: Check Assignment
Check that the affected number is assigned to a user or service in 8x8 Admin Console.
Log in to 8x8 Admin Console and navigate to Phone Numbers.
Search for the affected number, using the international dialing code (e.g., +1 USA, +44 UK) and check the Number Status, as shown below. If the number is Available assign the number to the relevant user/service before testing again.
If the number is Assigned proceed to Step 2.
clipboard_eb3e518b46c52decd14310f143ebc401b.png
Step 2: Test Calls
Internal Testing
If the affected number is assigned, try calling it from an existing 8x8 number. If your calls do not work correctly when calling from one 8x8 telephone number to another then it would suggest an issue exists with the configuration of the user or service on your 8x8 account. In this case, check the settings of the service your porting number is assigned to, and create a case with 8x8 Support if you need assistance in checking the issue.
If your calls internally on the 8x8 platform are working, move on to external testing.
External Testing
Try calling the affected number from any non-8x8 telephone number, as this will test if calls outside the 8x8 platform are being routed correctly from the relevant network carrier to 8x8. If your external test calls are failing to connect, perform three test calls (ideally from multiple telephone numbers).
Number called from:
Network called from:     (the provider for the number you made the test call from)
Number called to: 
Call date & time:
Call result:                     (for example: Failed/Beeps Continuously/Reaches Incorrect Service)
Make a note of these details as we will need test call examples to investigate further.
Step 3: Let us know!
If your telephone numbers have been without service for 15 minutes or more do let us know!
We can then troubleshoot on our side, and work to identify what is needed to get you back online as soon as possible. Create a Case with 8x8 Support.
We would strongly recommend that you report the loss of service via your Number Transfer case, with the three test call examples, so that we can identify the root cause as quickly as possible. Once your loss of service has been reported, we will be in touch within one hour with the next steps or, ideally, a resolution.
There are several potential reasons for a service outage during a number port, and often the solution will require action from the previous network carrier. If we do need action from the previous carrier, we will ensure they are notified of the outage and will follow up regularly until the necessary action is taken.
Step 4: Additional Checks
If the above steps have been completed then our Global Number Porting team will now be working to investigate and resolve your loss of service. Whilst we identify the issue, also perform the following checks.
Check Other Priority Numbers Porting Today
If you are transferring multiple numbers to 8x8 then also test any other high priority numbers. When a loss of service is reported we will check the relevant port order, and any others you have taking place that day, but where possible we will prioritise telephone numbers you highlight as most important.
Check for Call Diverts
check and let us know if you have any call diverts active with your current provider or in the 8x8 platform. Forwarding calls to an alternative destination, or the current provider removing call diverts on the day of port, can cause unexpected test results so do let us know if any diverts are involved.
Check the Port Date for the Affected Number
If you are transferring your telephone numbers to 8x8 across multiple port dates check the affected number is due to port today. If the number is scheduled to port at a later date then the loss of service would need to be reported to the current provider.
Step 5: Escalation
Whilst the time to resolve an outage may vary, our Global Number Porting team aims to acknowledge any loss of service and confirm the next steps within one hour of the issue being reported. If you have followed the steps above to troubleshoot and report your service issue but have received no feedback from our team within one hour use the Escalate Case option via your 8x8 Support Portal. See Escalate a Case with 8x8 Support.
Step 6: Resolution
The timeline for restoring service will vary based on the root cause, but we will always work towards a fix as quickly as possible. Once a loss of service is reported we will keep you updated on any developments & actions taken, via your Number Transfer case, until a resolution is achieved.
Most outages are resolved during the same day, but on rare occasions there may be action outstanding from another provider, or network carrier, when their opening hours have ended. In this case, we will let you know when their business hours resume and will follow up with them the following business day.
When our testing indicates the issue has been resolved we will ask you to perform new test calls to ensure that the affected number is now working as expected.

911,https://git-scm.com/book/ms/v2/Git-Tools-Advanced-Merging,"7.8 Git Tools - Advanced Merging
Advanced Merging
Merging in Git is typically fairly easy. Since Git makes it easy to merge another branch multiple times, it means that you can have a very long lived branch but you can keep it up to date as you go, solving small conflicts often, rather than be surprised by one enormous conflict at the end of the series.

However, sometimes tricky conflicts do occur. Unlike some other version control systems, Git does not try to be overly clever about merge conflict resolution. Git’s philosophy is to be smart about determining when a merge resolution is unambiguous, but if there is a conflict, it does not try to be clever about automatically resolving it. Therefore, if you wait too long to merge two branches that diverge quickly, you can run into some issues.

In this section, we’ll go over what some of those issues might be and what tools Git gives you to help handle these more tricky situations. We’ll also cover some of the different, non-standard types of merges you can do, as well as see how to back out of merges that you’ve done.

Merge Conflicts
While we covered some basics on resolving merge conflicts in Basic Merge Conflicts, for more complex conflicts, Git provides a few tools to help you figure out what’s going on and how to better deal with the conflict.

First of all, if at all possible, try to make sure your working directory is clean before doing a merge that may have conflicts. If you have work in progress, either commit it to a temporary branch or stash it. This makes it so that you can undo anything you try here. If you have unsaved changes in your working directory when you try a merge, some of these tips may help you preserve that work.

Let’s walk through a very simple example. We have a super simple Ruby file that prints 'hello world'.

#! /usr/bin/env ruby

def hello
  puts 'hello world'
end

hello()
In our repository, we create a new branch named whitespace and proceed to change all the Unix line endings to DOS line endings, essentially changing every line of the file, but just with whitespace. Then we change the line “hello world” to “hello mundo”.

$ git checkout -b whitespace
Switched to a new branch 'whitespace'

$ unix2dos hello.rb
unix2dos: converting file hello.rb to DOS format ...
$ git commit -am 'Convert hello.rb to DOS'
[whitespace 3270f76] Convert hello.rb to DOS
 1 file changed, 7 insertions(+), 7 deletions(-)

$ vim hello.rb

912,https://www.hss.edu/conditions_microdiscectomy-surgery-for-herniated-disc.asp,"By Evan D. Sheha, MD
Microdiscectomy is a type of minimally invasive discectomy commonly used to treat a herniated disc. When a herniated disc compresses a spinal nerve, symptoms can include pain (which may extend down one or both arms and legs, as is the case in sciatica), muscle weakness and difficulty with repetitive motions.

A doctor and a patient reviewing a spinal X-ray.

What is microdiscectomy?
Microdiscectomy is a surgical procedure for the relief of pain and other symptoms that occur when a herniated disc in the spine presses on an adjacent nerve root. During the operation, the surgeon frees the nerve by removing small fragments of disc, bone and ligament.

Microdiscectomy is sometimes described as a minimally invasive spine surgery, because it requires only a small incision and the use of a microscope or surgical glasses, called loupes, to magnify the site where the injury has occurred. The surgeon also uses smaller tools and instruments to work in the restricted space of the spine. Microdiscectomy is a type of spinal decompression surgery, and the term microdecompression – which describes the surgical removal of any bone or ligament that is compressing a nerve – may also be used to describe the procedure. However, the term ""microdiscectomy"" is more specific to the removal of the fragment of herniated disc tissue that is causing the patient’s symptoms.

Because most patients will recover from a herniated disc without surgery, microdiscectomy is recommended only after conservative treatment, including physical therapy, cortisone shots, and other medication have been tried for a period of at least 6 to 12 weeks, without bringing relief. In some cases, motor weakness may be a reason to have this surgery sooner. Patients with cauda equina syndrome require immediate surgical intervention. This is a condition in which pressure on the nerves in the lower portion of the spine affects bladder and bowel function, but it affects less than 1% of people.","

916,https://parthianwv.com,"Parthian is actively ensuring the environmental and economic viability of our transition to a greener future.
Have you ever wondered what happens to an electric vehicle’s (EV) battery once it’s replaced and retired from a car? To many’s surprise, these batteries can still maintain upwards of 85% of their original capacity after their stint on the road, making them perfect for second-use applications, once they’ve been properly tested and inspected. If not put in second-use applications, alternative retirement methods for these batteries include throwing them in landfills or metallurgic recycling, which are inefficient, costly, and risks leaking thousands of lbs of toxic battery materials into the environment. Parthian Battery Solutions allows EV batteries to forgo these undesirable battery termination methods by repurposing them into stationary energy storage systems. By effectively doubling their life and ensuring the most use and value are extracted from these batteries, Parthian offers lithium-ion technology at prices other manufacturers can’t compete with. Choosing Parthian is choosing the cleaner, more affordable option.

Climate change and sustainability education in India and the place for arts-based practice: reflections from East Kolkata Wetlands
Abstract
In 2019 India was ranked seventh most affected nation by climate change, yet 65 per cent of the Indian population had not heard of climate change. India’s revised National Education Policy mentions climate change and environmental issues as part of its work towards reaching the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals. However, to date, climate education in India has tended to remain the responsibility of the secondary science teacher in many schools where resources are limited. Following calls for a more holistic and multidisciplinary approach – where students can link environmental issues with their lives – we reflect on three arts-based climate education exemplars with students from the East Kolkata Wetlands (EKW) (n = 150, 10–17-year-olds). We consider how these frame climate change and sustainable education as a collective learning experience, rather than as scientific concepts alone. We respond to Szczepankiewicz et al.’s model for climate education and propose that teacher training in the EKW context can be conceptualised through a three-stage, interconnected approach to pedagogy: building concepts, learning through hands-on activities and building communities is central. We suggest that these three generalisable tenets of student teacher practice should be explored in other areas of ecological fragility, as well as in spaces of economic insecurity.

Introduction
In 2019 India was ranked seventh most affected nation by the impacts of climate change (Eckstein et al., 2021) and yet 65 per cent of the general Indian population had not heard of climate change (Leiserowitz, 2018). Such dissonance has not emerged intentionally. A focus on environmental education has its genesis in the National Policy on Education, 1986, updated in 1992 (Government of India, 1998). It has been mandated by the Supreme Court of India and overseen by the National Council of Education Research. Environmental education, which includes climate change and sustainable education (CCSE), is part of teachers’ professional development offered through a distance education programme developed through the Centre for Environmental Education. The National Council for Teacher Education also developed a manual on environmental education for student teachers. Through all this, the protection of the environment is a common feature around which the National Curriculum Framework is developed. More recently, India’s revised National Education Policy (MHRD, 2020) mentions climate change and environmental issues as part of its work towards reaching the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These 17 goals, agreed by the United Nations (UN) in 2015, have 169 targets to be realised by 2030. The goals of specific interest to this article include issues relating to: promoting decent and sustained work for all; making settlements sustainable with appropriate production and consumption patterns; and conserving and sustainably using marine and land resources. Education in India has been framed as a way of raising awareness of climate change and its impacts in line with the SDGs (Government of India, 2020), thus developing educated and engaged eco-citizens. Such citizens are situated within the context of sustainable development, wherein social equity, improved quality of life, aspirations for a better life, opportunity, democracy, participation, inclusion, health and positive social change are embedded (Agyeman and Evans, 2004). In this sense, sustainability, environmental justice and social good are entwined (Mor Barak, 2008). More widely, there is growing concern about the role of the eco-citizen in sustainability and climate change education due to the challenges of personal reflection on self, relationship with others and environment, and care of place (McEwen et al., 2020).

In this context, a series of activities was devised that linked knowledge, locality and the development of the eco-citizen using a cross-curricular arts-based pedagogy with minimal resources. While the broader objective of the project was to compare pedagogies for CCSE in the UK and India, this article focuses on the series of activities developed and reflected on by practitioners in India to inform teacher education. The specific questions this article explores are:

How can pedagogies that support learners’ local knowledge enhance engagement with issues surrounding CCSE in India and the development of eco-citizens?","UCL Press Journals

Mezzanines
Porta-King’s Modular Mezzanines transform unused vertical space into functional work or storage space. When building out becomes difficult or too costly, build up with modular mezzanines and platforms. These units are easy to install and have the added benefit of being reconfigured when floor plan changes deem necessary. Mezzanines are not really reconfigurable but they can be added onto as needs change.

Mezzanines are a Practical, Space-Saving Solutions for a More Productive Floor
No matter the desired application, Porta-King is dedicated to making sure that you get a safe and reliable product that will meet your needs. That’s why we design, build, and erect mezzanines for your facility that help improve worker safety, allow access to high areas, and/or provide the additional storage you need. Mezzanines are really intended for added space whether it’s for storage or equipment, machinery, and personnel.

One of the most cost-effective solutions to working with limited space is to build up instead of out. Prefabricated modular mezzanines help:

Make more room in the workplace by creating new space while maintaining the area underneath for personnel, additional equipment, or other storage opportunities.
Keep equipment safely off the floor and out of your employees’ way. Elevating equipment also protects it from floods and other accidents.
Create new employee workspaces without constructing brand new expansions.
Support multi-story modular structures that are extra tall or have large clear span conditions.
By adding layers to the workplace with modular mezzanines and increasing accessibility, you’ll be able to save valuable space and make your workplace more efficient.

Mezzanine Video Gallery

Porta-King structural steel mezzanines are a cost efficient way to easily create additional space for storage or manufacturing by utilizing existing ceiling space inside new or existing buildings. Additional floor space is created by going up, not out, saving you the considerable cost of new construction. The prefabricated design also saves time since all components arrive prefabricated and ready for immediate installation.

Unlike many of our competitors, we’ll supply you with a truly prefabricated mezzanine system. All of our connecting hardware is pre-welded onto the structural components prior to shipping. Many of our competitors call their mezzanines prefabricated, but that just means the various components used to construct their mezzanines are prefabricated prior to shipping. Unlike a Porta-King mezzanine, this doesn’t always mean these components arrive welded to the structural components and ready to be mechanically fastened together.

This video demonstrates the speed in which our mezzanines can be installed. This 18′ wide by 48′ long mezzanine, including our single piece, sectional guard rail was completed by a two man crew in just 2 days.


Note the ease with which our 6′ wide sliding gate operates. Heavy-duty steel construction ensures years of trouble free service. Other mezzanine gate options are also available.
Custom Designs that Prioritize Safety
Workplace accidents are dangerous and costly. All Porta-King’s modular mezzanines and platforms are IBC compliant and are fitted to your desired application to ensure safety and reliability. These modular steel mezzanines offer:

Guard railings on the platform and staircases that are factory welded sections to enable faster field installation. Railings prevent employees working at higher elevations from falling.
Gusseted type 3 connections to improve the modular structure’s stability and resistance even under seismic conditions.
Seamless integration with other modular products to ensure optimal fit and function.

More than 1,100 active incubators empowering Indian startup ecosystem
Oct 04, 2024, 14:40 IST
 - Sakshi Post
New Delhi, Oct 4 (IANS) There are more than 1,100 active incubators nurturing startups in the Indian ecosystem, according to a new report on Friday.

The joint research report, ‘India Incubator Kaleidoscope 2024’ was released by NSRCEL, the startup incubator at IIM Bangalore, and the Centre for Research on Start-ups and Risk Financing (CREST) IIT Madras in Bengaluru.

It showed that the number of incubators in the Indian ecosystem has grown steadily, with Tier I cities housing almost half of all incubators (48 per cent).

Chennai leads with a high proportion of academic incubators (82 per cent), whereas Bengaluru and Gurugram have a high proportion of industry incubators at 71 per cent and 84 per cent respectively.

The incubator density in India is 0.8 incubators per million population, whereas countries like the US, UK, and China range between 8 and 10 incubators per million population, said the report noting that indicates the need for setting up more incubators in the country, said the report.

“In the growth of the Indian startup ecosystem, incubators play a very crucial role, and their contribution has been expanding in recent years. Conceptualised initially to facilitate the formation of start-ups, today incubators perform multiple roles such as bringing together scientific and business expertise, channelising capital to promising start-ups, and increasing awareness of startups in the society,” said Amitabh Kant, G20 Sherpa, and ex-CEO, NITI Aayog, while launching the report.


“Incubators play a crucial role in making entrepreneurship more accessible and inclusive across the country but their activities and impact are not well understood. This report addresses that gap and highlights the need to both raise the level of incubation activity and enhance the quality of incubation efforts nationwide,” added Prof.Srivardhini Jha, Professor of Entrepreneurship, IIM Bangalore and Chairperson of NSRCEL.

Further, the report showed only 8.2 per cent of all startups undergo incubation. But 10 per cent of the incubators support 98 per cent of the startups that are incubated.

“This highlights an urgent need to improve the performance of incubators that are underutilised and to actively engage in outreach efforts to raise awareness about the benefits of incubation,” the report said.

It noted that incubation is sought after by students, young professionals, women founders, and those with modest financial resources.

Deep tech sectors such as AI/ML, data analytics, biotech, and other sectors showed a high incubation rate -- upward of 12 per cent.

The incubated startups (27.1 per cent) also secured the first round of funding earlier than non-incubated (15.4 per cent), the report said.

Despite being smaller in number, incubated startups have also won more awards in all leading startup awards and are engaged more actively in the creation of Intellectual Property.

The contribution of the incubated startups to the economy has also been significant.

The report showed that the annual average revenues in the initial years for every 100 incubated startups has been about 1,590 crores. The average value of assets for every 100 incubated startups by the ninth year from incorporation has been estimated at Rs 10,627 crore.

However, the revenue performance of startups associated with industry incubators is 50 per cent higher as compared to those supported by academic incubators, the report said.

Is this a Pages project, or an App?

Treating Impacted Teeth
Early Recognition Of Impacted Eyeteeth Is The Key To Successful Treatment
What Happens If The Eyetooth Will Not Erupt When Proper Space Is Available?
What To Expect From Surgery To Expose & Bracket An Impacted Tooth
Related Impacted Teeth Links

Treating Impacted Teeth

An impacted tooth simply means that it is “stuck” and cannot erupt into function. Patients frequently develop problems with impacted third molar (wisdom) teeth. These teeth get “stuck” in the back of the jaw and can develop painful infections, among a host of other problems (see Wisdom Teeth under Procedures). Since there is rarely a functional need for wisdom teeth, they are usually extracted if they develop problems. The maxillary cuspid (upper eyetooth) is the second most common tooth to become impacted. The cuspid tooth is a critical tooth in the dental arch and plays an important role in your “bite”. The cuspid teeth are very strong biting teeth and have the longest roots of any human teeth. They are designed to be the first teeth that touch when your jaws close together so they guide the rest of the teeth into the proper bite.

Normally, the maxillary cuspid teeth are the last of the “front” teeth to erupt into place. They usually come into place around age 13 and cause any space left between the upper front teeth to close tighter together. If a cuspid tooth gets impacted, every effort is made to get it to erupt into its proper position in the dental arch. The techniques involved to aid eruption can be applied to any impacted tooth in the upper or lower jaw, but most commonly they are applied to the maxillary cuspid (upper eye) teeth. Sixty percent of these impacted eyeteeth are located on the palatal (roof of the mouth) side of the dental arch. The remaining impacted eye teeth are found in the middle of the supporting bone but are stuck in an elevated position above the roots of the adjacent teeth, or are out to the facial side of the dental arch.

Early Recognition Of Impacted Eyeteeth Is The Key To Successful Treatment
The older the patient the more likely an impacted eyetooth will not erupt by natural forces alone, even if the space is available for the tooth to fit in the dental arch. The American Association of Orthodontists recommends that a panoramic x-ray, along with a dental examination, be performed on all dental patients at the age of seven to count the teeth and determine if there are problems with eruption of the adult teeth. It is important to determine whether all the adult teeth are present or if some adult teeth missing.

This exam is usually performed by your general dentist or hygienist who will refer you to an orthodontist if a problem is identified. Treating such a problem may involve an orthodontist placing braces to open spaces allowing for proper eruption of the adult teeth. Treatment may also require referral to an oral surgeon for extraction of over-retained baby teeth and/or selected adult teeth that are blocking the eruption of the all-important eyeteeth. The oral surgeon will also need to remove any extra teeth (supernumerary teeth) or growths that are blocking the eruption of any adult teeth.

If the eruption path is cleared and the space is opened up by age 11-12, there is a good chance that the impacted eyetooth will erupt with nature’s help. If the eyetooth is allowed to develop too much under the surface (by age 13-14), the impacted eyetooth will not erupt by itself, even with the space cleared for its eruption. If the patient is older (over 40), there is a much higher chance that the tooth will be fused in position. In these cases, the tooth will not budge despite all the efforts of the orthodontist and oral surgeon to erupt it into place. Sadly, the only option at this point is to extract the impacted tooth and consider an alternate treatment to replace it in the dental arch (crown on a dental implant or a fixed bridge).

What Happens If The Eyetooth Will Not Erupt When Proper Space Is Available?
In cases where the eyeteeth will not erupt spontaneously, the orthodontist and oral surgeon will work together to get these teeth to erupt. Each case must be evaluated on an individual basis, but treatment will usually involve a combined effort between the orthodontist and the oral surgeon. The most common scenario will call for the orthodontist to place braces on the teeth (at least the upper arch). A space will be opened to provide room for the impacted tooth to be moved into its proper position in the dental arch. If the baby eyetooth has not fallen out already, it is usually left in place until the space for the adult eyetooth is ready. Once the space is ready, the orthodontist will refer the patient to the oral surgeon to have the impacted eyetooth exposed and bracketed.

In a simple surgical procedure performed in the surgeon’s office, the gum on top of the impacted tooth will be lifted up to expose the hidden tooth underneath. If there is a baby tooth present it will be removed at the same time. Once the tooth is exposed, the oral surgeon will bond an orthodontic bracket to the exposed tooth. The bracket will have a miniature gold chain attached to it. The oral surgeon will guide the chain back to the orthodontic arch wire where it will be temporarily attached. Sometimes the surgeon will leave the exposed and impacted tooth completely uncovered by suturing the gum up high above the tooth, or making a window in the gum covering the tooth. Most of the time the gum will be returned to its original location and sutured back with only the chain remaining visible as it exits a small hole in the gum.

Shortly after surgery (1-14 days) the patient will return to the orthodontist. A rubber band will be attached to the chain to put a light eruptive pulling force on the impacted tooth. This will begin the process of moving the tooth into its proper place in the dental arch. This is a carefully controlled, slow process that may take up to a full year to complete. Remember, the goal is to erupt the impacted tooth and not to extract it. Once the tooth has moved into the arch in its final position, the gum around it will be evaluated to make sure it is sufficiently strong and healthy to last for a lifetime of chewing and tooth brushing. In some circumstances, especially those where the tooth had to be moved a long distance, there may be some minor “gum surgery” required to add bulk to the gum tissue over the relocated tooth so that it remains healthy during normal function. Your dentist or orthodontist will explain this procedure to you if it applies to your specific situation.","

What Is The Virtual Number And How It Can Help Businesses To Grow?
 August 24, 2022

 Arun Upadhyay

what is the virtual number
Virtual phone numbers are today’s advanced interaction channels that allow communication with anyone worldwide using internet-connected devices.

Therefore, it is easily understandable why online virtual phone numbers’ popularity is increasing daily. These numbers not only offer flexible communication facilities but also are equipped with a layer of privacy that maintains the calling process’s integrity. 

Today in this blog post, we will break down a few essential details about virtual numbers and how it benefits businesses. 

So let’s get started…

What Is A Virtual Phone Number?
Virtual phone numbers are quite similar to telephone numbers but are not bound to a physical location. These numbers allow users to make or receive calls on any phone, such as cell phones, VoIP, or Softphones. Today virtual phone numbers have become an integral part of businesses Globally.

With the help of these numbers, companies can connect with customers worldwide regardless of their location. It offers them an absolute way of communication with their customers.

These numbers are precisely like standard telephone numbers, and this is the main reason why customers are unable to distinguish between them. 

How Does Virtual Phone Number Work?
Unlike standard telephone numbers, virtual phone numbers do not require any physical address or a Sim card to accept calls. It utilizes VoiceOver internet protocol (VoIP) to receive incoming calls. For making a call, users dial a number that uses internet-based protocols to forward the call to an actual number.

The entire call-making process does not require any telephone lines. Also, if the user wishes, the call can be easily transmitted to his laptop or mobile device. This is how virtual phone numbers work and offer a seamless communication facility to the users.

It is a highly advanced technology used globally to make calls and text through WhatsApp, Google Voice, or Messaging.  These numbers originated in the cloud and can be easily integrated with pre-existing telephone numbers that you already own. These numbers are also called cloud telephony.

Traditional phone numbers come with a few limitations; for example, if you use your landline or cell phone, you must sit and wait in one spot to receive or make calls. However, smartphones have some liberty as they allow you to move with your phone numbers. 

But to connect with the other party, you still need to ensure whether you are reachable or not. Virtual phone numbers are completely free from such boundaries. These numbers help you stay connected whether traveling or working from home. You don’t have to feel tied to a physical location or device.

How To Get A Virtual Phone Number?
Virtual phone numbers are undoubtedly more beneficial than traditional landline numbers. They can efficiently work for small businesses and larger organizations that need to deal with huge call volumes. 

If you wish to get a virtual phone number for your organization then you must have a complete understanding of these cloud telephony numbers and how you can utilize them for your requirements. 

We Can Categorize Virtual Phone Numbers Into Three Types – 
Virtual Local phone numbers
Toll-free numbers
Vanity numbers
Virtual Local Phone Numbers
These local virtual numbers are known as rate centers or area codes because they belong to specific geographical locations

Toll-Free Numbers
People can call on toll-free numbers without spending a single penny. Businesses use these virtual toll-free numbers for offering free calling services to customers. You can easily recognize these numbers as they follow some pattern. Usually, these numbers start with 866, 800, and 888. 

Vanity Phone Numbers
Vanity numbers are unique, catchy, and easily memorable.

Remember, you can utilize your existing phone number and integrate it with the virtual phone system. Organizations that install virtual phone systems have freedom, flexibility, and better savings. 

If you are looking for virtual numbers for your business from India’s  most reliable VoIP providers, then you can avail of the same service from Fonada, a leading cloud telephony service provider in India, and establish seamless communication with your customers 

Prime Difference Between Virtual And Regular Phone Numbers?
Local telephone companies are responsible for providing regular phone numbers, and these number requires a phone line for the function. Telephone companies usually assign phone lines to the pre-decided street address. The installation of a telecom line is a bit complicated and not feasible in every office. 

However, there are no such boundaries associated with virtual phone numbers, and they are not bound to one location only. It can efficiently work with employees in and out of the office because they have access to the same cloud PBX (private branch exchange).

This means businesses can efficiently operate over virtual phone numbers irrespective of location, time, and zone. Also, you have the liberty to restrict the accessibility of your virtual phone number depending on your staff’s availability.

Major Benefits Of A Virtual Number For A Business?
There Are Several Benefits Of Using A Virtual Phone Number For A Business. Some Of Them Are Discussed Below:

Cost Efficient
People can use virtual phone systems from every corner of the world without paying high calling charges. You can offer a toll-free phone number to your callers, and they can connect with you without facing any difficulty at no cost. ","Fonada logo

A Big-Box-Store Allegory
A satirist of literary Brooklyn now explores life in an upstate shopping warehouse.

Probably all of us have been inside a place like Town Square location #1512, the fictional big-box store that provides the setting for Adelle Waldman’s new novel, Help Wanted. It’s the kind with colorful seasonal displays and wide aisles, the kind that in the ’80s and ’90s came to signify the peak of American commerce: the convenience of being able to buy baby food, a lawn mower, and a plastic Christmas tree all in one brightly lit, airplane-hangar-size space.

It’s surprising, really, that such stores, emblematic of American capitalism as they are, don’t feature prominently in more novels. Waldman’s Town Square seems almost too obviously allegorical. At #1512, empty shelves pockmark the aisles, giving the store a dilapidated feel. “Corporate” (a vague presence) wants store managers to prioritize low budgets above all else, so the managers have concluded that empty shelves are preferable to spending money on workers to stock items. Business has faded, stolen by an unnamed online retail giant. This image of shrinkage evokes the mood of the novel, which takes place in fictional, hollowed-out Potterstown, in upstate New York, its infrastructure now outsize, dating to a time of more prosperity, more people, more life. The big companies that once had local factories have departed for cheaper workforces, and the residents who didn’t leave with them scramble to assemble enough employment to pay their bills.

A generation ago, Potterstown fostered a solid working class, but its current young adults have few prospects for stability. Half the people working on Town Square’s Movement team (formerly Logistics, and based in the store’s adjoining warehouse) live, as 23-year-old Nicole did until recently, with their mother or grandmother. Nicole’s mother likes to remind her that, in her 20s, she was already married and a homeowner, markers of security that held steady even when the local job market tanked. For Nicole, who has a baby and a fiancé, prospects feel more limited.

She couldn’t wait tables, she just couldn’t. Not after listening to her mother complain all these years. Her mother had been at the diner for twenty-five years, ever since the company she’d worked for before Nicole was born, the one that made keyboards for IBM, moved to Mexico … And it wasn’t like she and Marcus could just up and move to a different place with more jobs. They relied on both her mom and his for babysitting. They couldn’t afford day care. And Nicole didn’t even have a car of her own.
All employees at Town Square, except managers, have been reduced to part-time, so that the company doesn’t have to offer benefits or a guaranteed number of hours. During the holidays, Town Square hires temporary part-time workers to avoid giving their year-round staff enough hours to qualify for health care. One store veteran complains that 15 years ago, when their branch opened, “working full-time, forty hours a week, wasn’t some big privilege—something you had to beg for. It was standard. That meant you could work here and live on what you made. You wouldn’t be rich, but you could live. If you wanted to make more, you could work overtime. Not anymore.”","

JR Motorsports to enter Daytona 500 with Justin Allgaier UPDATE
 
January 15, 2025  at 4:00 PM
UPDATE: JR Motorsports today announced that NASCAR Hall of Famer and two-time DAYTONA 500 winner Dale Earnhardt Jr., along with 10-time Grammy Award-winning singer, songwriter and musician Chris Stapleton, have come together to field the inaugural entry for JRM in the NASCAR Cup Series in the 2025 running of the DAYTONA 500. In partnership with Buffalo Trace Distillery, the World’s Most Award-Winning Distillery, JRM will field a No. 40 Traveller Whiskey Chevrolet, inspired by the Blend No. 40 utilized in every bottle of Traveller, for their maiden voyage in “The Great American Race” with the reigning and defending NASCAR Xfinity Series Champion Justin Allgaier behind the wheel.

“We’ve been waiting for the right moment for JR Motorsports,” said Earnhardt Jr. “With Justin winning the Xfinity Series championship and Chris Stapleton’s undeniable star power, the planets aligned for this perfect opportunity to enter this year’s DAYTONA 500.”

Proudly blended and bottled at Buffalo Trace Distillery under Master Distiller Harlen Wheatley’s expert supervision, Traveller is the result of countless hours of testing, tasting and dedication to craftsmanship that have produced powerful songs and world-class whiskeys. Since launching in January 2024, it has been honored as the Most Awarded Super Premium Whiskey, garnering 15 awards including the “Master” medal from The Luxury Masters and the “Best in Class Gold” award at the 2024 Whiskies of the World competition.

“Traveller Whiskey joining JR Motorsports for their inaugural entry into the Cup Series at the DAYTONA 500 feels like a very natural partnership,” said Stapleton. “I’m honored to be apart of this historic moment with Dale and Kelley, and excited to see Justin race the No. 40 Traveller Whiskey Chevrolet in Daytona.”

Bottled at 90 proof, Traveller Whiskey is characterized by notes of oak, sweet maple, tart currant and leather. Complex aromas of vanilla, aged fruit and buttery shortbread are rounded off by caramel and a touch of oak. The flavor profile also showcases a touch of sweetness, followed by spice, toasted nut and oak flavors, closing with a robust finish. Traveller is a completely unique combination of whiskeys hand-selected from The Sazerac Company’s award-winning distilleries.

Piloting the No. 40 Traveller Whiskey Chevrolet for JRM is the organization’s most decorated driver in Allgaier. Allgaier, from Riverton, Ill., is the defending NXS Champion, a five-time NXS Most Popular Driver as voted on by the fans, the all-time NXS series leader in top-10 finishes, and JRM’s all-time leader in wins. Additionally, Allgaier is a previous competitor in the Cup Series, having raced full-time at the highest form of North American motorsports during the 2014 and 2015 seasons. The veteran driver most recently competed at the Cup level during the 2024 season in substitution for 2021 Cup Series Champion Kyle Larson at Charlotte Motor Speedway, taking the checkered flag in the 13th position.

“This is an incredible honor to be driving JR Motorsports’ inaugural entry into the Cup Series, and to do it with not only Dale and Kelley, but Chris Stapleton and Traveller Whiskey makes this even more special,” said Allgaier. “Entering into the DAYTONA 500 has been a goal of this company for a long time and I know that we are going to have everything we need to go out and contend for the win. This is going to be special for sure.”

JRM’s quest for the DAYTONA 500 marks the first time that Earnhardt Jr. and Earnhardt-Miller have entered a race in the Cup Series as team-owners. Under their leadership in the NXS, JRM has been a pillar of success, earning 88 wins and four championships with drivers Chase Elliott, William Byron, Tyler Reddick and most recently with Allgaier.

Be sure to catch Allgaier and the No. 40 Traveller Whiskey Chevrolet all week long at Daytona International Speedway as JRM attempts to qualify for the 2025 running of the DAYTONA 500, beginning on Wednesday, Feb.12, at 8:00 p.m. ET for DAYTONA 500 Qualifying, followed by the Duels on Thursday, Feb. 13, at 7:00 p.m. ET and culminating with the 67th running of “The Great American Race” on Sunday, Feb. 15, at 2:30 p.m. ET on FOX, MRN and SiriusXM NASCAR Radio Channel 90.

Traveller Whiskey is widely available to retailers, bars and restaurants through Sazerac’s United States and global distributor networks at a suggested retail price of $39.99 (local taxes and fees will vary). To learn more, visit www.travellerwhiskey.com.

— JR Motorsports —

ORIGINAL POST: The NASCAR team owned by Hall of Famer Dale Earnhardt Jr. will attempt to make its Cup Series debut in the Daytona 500 with a champion driver and a partnership with a Grammy Award-winning artist.

JR Motorsports has entered reigning Xfinity Series champion Justin Allgaier into next month’s season-opening “Great American Race” in a Chevrolet sponsored by the whiskey label created by 10-time Grammy winner Chris Stapleton. Traveller Whiskey is a collaborative blend created by Buffalo Trace Distillery with Stapleton.

Allgaier will have to qualify for the Daytona 500 — a race his boss has won twice — on either speed in time trials or via one of the qualifying races. It marks the first time in JRM history the team has entered a race in the Cup Series, and Earnhardt said the team will be focused on qualifying via speed powered by a Hendrick Motorsports engine.

The deal came together when Stapleton, who has a friendship with Rick Hendrick, approached Hendrick about a NASCAR collaboration with Traveller Whiskey. Hendrick put Stapleton in touch with Earnhardt as he also has an ownership stake with JRM.

…

Earnhardt said there have been no discussions on future Cup ventures for JRM beyond trying to make the Daytona 500. It will be a high-pressure situation for the Greg Ives-led team as Earnhardt has warned them he and his sister will be hovering from the moment the car is unloaded at Daytona Beach International Speedway through every mile it turns on the track.

Agreement envisions CHC Helicopter operating and Heli-One maintaining Supernal eVTOL vehicles
H1-Supernal_1080
From left to right: Eric Buer, director of business development, Heli-One and David Rottblatt, senior director of strategy and commercialization, Supernal

IRVINE, CALIFORNIA and IRVING, TEXAS, March 10, 2024 – Supernal LLC – Hyundai Motor Group’s (HMG’s) Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) company today announced an agreement with CHC Helicopter, the global helicopter flight services company specializing in offshore transportation and search and rescue operations, and CHC subsidiary Heli-One, a leading global provider of rotor-wing maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) services, to scale shared electric vertical and take-off landing (eVTOL) vehicle operations.

The companies will establish a collaborative framework to develop and scale AAM networks, integrating Supernal’s vehicles, CHC’s flight operations services and Heli-One’s MRO products and services. Specifically, the objective is to understand how CHC could operate Supernal’s eVTOL vehicles in the future for AAM commercial passenger transportation, as well as for potential applications with its existing flight services client base in offshore energy, search-and-rescue, and emergency medical services. The three companies will also explore how Heli-One could provide a range of potential eVTOL MRO services for CHC internally and other operators of Supernal’s eVTOL vehicles globally.

“Supernal is pleased to partner with CHC, one of the world's largest rotorcraft operators, and Heli-One, a leading global provider of rotorcraft MRO services, as we work to commercialize eVTOL vehicles,"" said Jaiwon Shin, president of Hyundai Motor Group and CEO of Supernal. ""The collaboration will ensure Supernal is the OEM of choice for future eVTOL operators.""

“In partnering with CHC and Heli-One, we are confident we will devise new ways to meet customer needs through Advanced Air Mobility,” said David Rottblatt, senior director of strategy and commercialization, Supernal. ""Matching CHC’s global experience and Heli-One’s support services with Supernal’s scaled eVTOL vehicle manufacturing will expand seamless operations as the industry matures.”

Supernal plans to deliver its first eVTOL vehicles to operators in 2028, which will cruise at 120 miles per hour with an initial range of 60 miles. CHC offers local expertise across a global network with a focus on safety, reliability and sustainability. The company’s strong history helps it deliver unmatched services across a range of sectors.

“We are excited to support Supernal's visionary approach to Advanced Air Mobility and commitment to vertical flight with CHC's 75 years of global vertical lift operations and sustainment excellence,” said Tom Burke, president and CEO, CHC. “The companies’ collective vision is to be the global leader in vertical aviation by delivering safe, reliable, efficient and sustainable services to support our customers' journey and success.”

Heli-One is a leading provider of helicopter in-service support services with certifications and expertise in a broad range of airframes and components from major helicopter and engine manufacturers. Heli-One is positioned to provide MRO services to Supernal vehicles in markets where the eVTOL OEM does not initially open facilities.

“We are proud to partner with Supernal on its innovative work developing the future of air travel,” said Miguel Carrasco, president, Heli-One. “Heli-One, CHC and Supernal are well suited due to our shared commitment to safety and exceptional performance.”

The three companies are actively working to identify geographies, use cases, routes and networks for deployment, as well as partnership models for future market development.

ABSTRACT
The full approval of two SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines, Comirnaty and Spikevax, has greatly accelerated the development of numerous mRNA vaccine candidates targeting infectious diseases and cancer. mRNA vaccines provide a rapid, safe, and versatile manufacturing process while eliciting strong humoral and cellular immune responses, making them particularly beneficial for addressing emerging pandemics. Recent advancements in modified nucleotides and lipid nanoparticle delivery systems have further emphasized the potential of this vaccine platform. Despite these transformative opportunities, significant improvements are needed to enhance vaccine efficacy, stability, and immunogenicity.

This review outlines the fundamentals of mRNA vaccine design, the manufacturing process, and administration strategies, along with various optimization approaches. It also offers a comprehensive overview of the mRNA vaccine candidates developed since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the challenges posed by emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, and current strategies to address these variants. Finally, we discuss the potential of broad-spectrum and combined mRNA vaccines and examine the challenges and future prospects of the mRNA vaccine platform.

French logistics company Jacky Perrenot buys 40 eDaily vans from Iveco
The Italian commercial vehicle manufacturer Iveco will supply 40 eDaily electric vans to VIR by JP, a subsidiary of the French Jacky Perrenot Group. They will be used for delivery services and are designed to help overcome the challenges posed by environmental zones in city centres.

However, the 40 eDaily vehicles that have now been handed over are not fully-fledged vans, but rather chassis that were subsequently completed with a customised body by the customer. The vehicles are intended for the delivery of heavy and bulky products such as furniture, sofas, household appliances or fitness equipment. The electric vans mainly operate in the Paris region, but also in Bordeaux and Salon-de-Provence. Each vehicle covers an average of 150 kilometres per day for VIR by JP and completes its route with a single overnight charge at the depot.

For the eDaily fleet, VIR by JP has opted for a chassis with a 23-square-metre box body. The vehicles are equipped with three battery packs and have a range of up to 330 kilometres. The electric motor delivers up to 140 kW and offers up to 400 Nm of torque.

According to the Iveco press release, the Jacky Perrenot Group has invested in this fleet in order to meet the challenges of environmental zones and support its customers in the transformation to more sustainable modes of transport. The eDailys enable quiet deliveries and significantly reduce local emissions. By using the eDaily, transport companies can fulfil the European CO2 emission requirements for new cars and commercial vehicles from 2035 at an early stage.

Jacky Perrenot invested in electromobility at an early stage: At the end of 2023, the logistics company stated that it intended to procure 168 electric trucks and 90 truck charging stations to go with them. In summer 2024, Jacky Perrenot then specified that 100 of the electric trucks alone would come from MAN. The company is aiming to have 250 electric vehicles in its fleet by the end of 2025.

10 fiches actions pour améliorer l’accueil, l’intégration et l’accompagnement personnalisé des nouveaux arrivants

Date: 19 août 2020
Author: Guillaume Glénard
0 Comments
La Direction générale de l’administration et de la fonction publique (DGFAP) vient de publier 10 fiches actions pour améliorer l’accueil, l’intégration et l’accompagnement personnalisé des nouveaux arrivants.

C’est le fruit des travaux du groupe de travail interministériel, co-piloté par la DGAFP et le ministère des Armées.

Ces travaux ont abouti à mettre à disposition des acteurs RH dix « fiches actions » qui reprennent les différentes étapes et composantes des dispositifs d’accueil, d’intégration et d’accompagnement personnalisé des nouveaux arrivants. Des capsules vidéo à destination des managers sont également en cours de réalisation et vont venir compléter la boite à outil du « onboarding ».

Même si ces fiches ont été d’abord réalisées pour les services de l’État, elle peuvent être utiles à tout employeur public.

In this article
 

Calculating Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) and Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) involves estimating the number of calories an individual needs to maintain or adjust their body weight/composition and support their daily activities. 

 

There is currently no calculation or guideline that does not use sex assigned at birth to calculate BMR or TDEE. As such, we are limited to the parameters of the standard calculations when calculating BMR and TDEE in-app. 


This complicates things when individuals are either in transition or do not identify with a binary gender categorization (as this is non-specific when calculating values). 

To calculate TDEE and BMR in the app, individuals can: 

Select the sex that most closely aligns with their stage in transition. 
Select their sex assigned at birth. 
Note for selecting the Non-Binary option: 

Selecting non-binary will result in no in-app calculations being produced at this time due to the limitations of the equations used. Please refer to this section for general calculations. 

Additional Considerations 
Though there isn't a one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to gender and fitness–  here are a few considerations for calculating BMR and TDEE for transgender or non-binary individuals: 


 

Seek Professional Guidance:

As there is currently no standard means of calculating TDEE/BMR for non-cis gendered individuals– consulting with a healthcare professional, such as a registered dietitian experienced in transgender healthcare, is the best option for receiving personalized calculations. 

Healthcare professionals can take into account an individual's unique hormonal profile, any gender-affirming interventions, and other relevant factors when calculating TDEE and BMR. 

 

 

Use Generalized Calculations as a Starting Point:

In the absence of specific guidance, individuals can still use general formulas to estimate their TDEE and BMR.  

We use the Mifflin-St. Jeor equations to calculate TDEE and BMR in-app, which is one of many commonly used formulas that take into account factors such as age, weight, height, and sex assigned at birth.

TDEE/BMR Calculator with Various Equations

Monitor and Adjust:
Calculations are just a starting point, and it's essential to monitor and adjust based on individual responses (regardless of sex or gender). Regularly tracking body weight, energy levels, and overall well-being can help determine if the estimated calorie intake is appropriate or requires modification. 


 

Focus on Individual Needs and Goals:
Every person is unique, and their nutritional needs may vary based on factors beyond gender identity.

Factors like physical activity levels, overall health, body composition goals, medications, and personal preferences play important roles in determining dietary requirements. Customizing a nutrition plan that aligns with individual needs and goals can optimize overall health and well-being.

We’ve all been there. I’m sure at some point in the last year you’ve dealt with a crappy boss, impossible coworker or a part of your job that is unnecessarily stressful.

I’ve been lucky in my career to experience a wide variety of team dynamics: first at very large enterprises as a management consultant, then at a mid-size startup and now leading the fast-growing Hive team.

Related: Why Meditation Is The Next Big Productivity Tool

I’ve noticed that there’s a very simple formula that guides 90% of my thoughts when a friend or colleague seeks advice on a person-to-person challenge in their workplace.

Step 1: Now
As the old saying goes:

The best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago, the second best time is now.

Same goes for these challenges. I’ve never heard a compelling reason to take action later than the following day.

Step 2: EPR
Humans are funny creatures. A good way to structure your thinking about someone else’s behavior is to look at it from 3 angles, an approach borrowed from the playbook of major organization change used by major management consultants:

Related: How Working Out At Lunch Made Me 90% More Productive

Emotional: How does this person feel? What part is their personal happiness / hopes / stresses playing in this situation?

Political: How does this situation affect the person’s navigation of their career, their power, their credibility with their colleagues?

Rational: Is there a practical, logical reason for the issue? Is the situation caused by a perfectly reasonable behavior?

Step 3: Communicate
This is the hardest part, but also the most important. Frequently, we create an imaginary barrier that stops us from simply articulating exactly how we feel. 9 times out of 10, the best thing is to ask them what they’re doing for lunch, grab a sandwich together, and have a good old-fashioned yap.

Have a think about a work frustration, run it through these three, and see how it goes!

At Morningside AI, we believe the conversation around artificial intelligence has been dominated by hype, fear, and empty promises. Too many businesses have been left with pretty slides and failed prototypes, but no real progress.

The challenges ahead are real: slowing productivity, tighter competition, and rising expectations from customers and employees. The margin for inefficiency and lackluster performance is gone. Every company now faces a choice - speed up or fall behind.

AI is the path forward. It provides the infrastructure for a new level of business performance. Used well, AI does not replace people. It fundamentally redefines how they create value. And it sharpens how organizations think, decide, and execute.

That’s where we come in.

We’re not the kind of consultancy that talks about what could happen someday. We build what actually works today. We design the automations, copilots, and systems that reshape how your teams operate, and we make sure the change lasts. Then, we help your people become fluent in the tools that will define their work for the next decade.

We call this becoming AI-first. Not just aware of the technology, but built on top of it.

That’s why Morningside AI exists: to help forward-thinking businesses turn AI from an abstract idea into a real competitive advantage. We don’t just implement AI. We build AI operating systems for the next decade of growth.

The future has arrived. And it belongs to those who are willing to step off the sidelines and into the action.

L'ancien champion cycliste colombien Luis « Lucho » Herrera s'est présenté jeudi devant la justice pour nier toute implication dans le meurtre de quatre paysans en 2002.

L'ÉQUIPE

Deux anciens paramilitaires, membres des escadrons d'extrême droite qu'une lutte sanglante a opposés aux guérillas de gauche en Colombie, ont affirmé devant les juges que Herrera leur avait remis près de 10 000 dollars (environ 8 745 euros) pour tuer quatre de ses voisins, soupçonnés d'être des rebelles qui voulaient le kidnapper.

Une source au parquet a indiqué à l'AFP que l'ex-grimpeur aux trois victoires d'étape sur le Tour de France, âgé de 64 ans, avait été convoqué libre à Bogota pour donner sa version. Des journalistes de l'AFP l'ont vu arriver jeudi au siège du parquet de la capitale colombienne en compagnie de sa compagne pour être entendu par un procureur. N'étant pas inculpé dans cette affaire, son témoignage n'a pas d'effet juridique contraignant.","

That didn't stop him, Gulfport cops say By Robin Fitzgerald Updated May 21, 2018 6:44 PM Tyrone Ross Gulfport Police Department GULFPORT About six years ago, a Gulfport man knowingly exposed two people to HIV. The man, now 29, served time in prison and is on parole — and has done it again, Gulfport police say. Tyrone Ross met a man while both were in jail and was intimate with him behind bars, and they continued their relationship after they were released, according to the victim's complaint, Police Sgt. Clayton Fulks said Monday. Police arrested Ross on Sunday on the same charge from his prior convictions. He had been under a state Health Department quarantine when he previously exposed two people to the human immunodeficiency virus in 2012. He was convicted in October 2014, and Circuit Judge Lisa Dodson sentenced Ross a month later to 10 years in prison. The potential prison term for the crime is three to 10 years. Ross served a portion of his sentence and has been under the supervision of a state parole officer. Until his arrest on the new charge Sunday, he was scheduled to finish parole on March 21, 2022, the state prison website shows. Witnessing a crime and reporting it can be just as frightening as being the victim of a crime. Here’s what you should do if you witness illegal activity. By Nicole L. Cvetnic Ross initially had been arrested on three counts of exposing three people to HIV by bodily substance. He served time on two of the three counts.

986,https://karmagroup.com/news-events/bali-booklist,"Bali Booklist
For a tiny island, Bali punches way above its weight when it comes to sheer appeal. From its unique culture and religion to its cuisine, its rich artistic heritage, the variety of landscapes and its emergence as a bohemian hub in the 20th century… little wonder writers have long swooned over its many-splendoured charms… our Literary Luminaries over at Ultimate Library have assembled some of the best offerings to whet your appetite for your next Bali visit…


1. A Brief History of Indonesia: Sultans, Spices and Tsunamis by Tim Hannigan
Indonesian history and culture are especially relevant today as the Island nation is an emerging power in Southeast Asia. It is a land of incredible diversity and unending paradoxes that has a long and rich history stretching back a thousand years and more. Indonesia is the fabled “Spice Islands” of every school child’s dreams one of the most colourful and fascinating countries in history.

 A Brief History of Indonesia


2. A House in Bali by Colin McPhee
When writer and composer Colin McPhee first heard gamelan he realised that it was the music of his dreams. Written in 1947, this book still continues to inspire lovers of Bali with its passion, excitement, evocative descriptions and sheer fascination of the islanders’ way of life. Perhaps it was his musical background that allowed the beauty of the island to sing through every page of his story.

 A House in Bali


3. The Sea Sisters by Lucy Clarke
There are some currents in the relationship between sisters that run so dark and so deep, it’s better for the people swimming on the surface never to know what’s beneath . . . Katie’s world is shattered by the news her younger sister, Mia, has been found dead. With only the entries of Mia’s travel journal as her guide, Katie retraces the last few months of her sister’s life, and – page by page, country by country – begins to uncover the mystery surrounding her death.

 The Sea Sisters


4. Indonesia Etc. Exploring the Improbable Nation by Elizabeth Pisani
Elizabeth Pisani, who first worked in Indonesia 25 years ago as a foreign correspondent, set out in 2011, travelling over 13,000 miles, to rediscover its enduring attraction, and to find the links which bind together this disparate nation. Fearless and funny, and sharply perceptive, she has drawn a compelling, entertaining and deeply informed portrait of a captivating nation.

Hayleys to dispose Singer stake; credit outlook revised to Negative
28 Sep 2020  - 1221     

Hayleys will retain controlling stake post disposal of Singer shares
Hayleys’ total debt stock at Rs.121.5bn by end-June against Rs.63.5bn equity 
Diversified conglomerate Hayleys PLC is seeking to partly divest its Singer Sri Lanka PLC stake in less than three years into its blockbuster acquisition of the consumer durables behemoth as the group accumulated debt throughout its acquisition spree, which has now begun to weigh on its financial 
performance and credit rating. 


Hayleys, along with its group entities in concert, acquired 61.73 percent stake in Singer in September 2017 for Rs.11 billion.  A major part of the deal or 45.34 percent stake was funded through debt—which is known as a ‘leveraged buy-out’.  


As of June 30, 2020 Hayleys and its constituent parties held 90.43 percent stake in Singer while Hayleys’ controlling shareholder Dhammika Perera held another 1.85 percent. 
Hayleys is expected to retain the controlling stake in Singer should any disposal of shares occur, ICRA Lanka said noting the delay in such a move due to not so conducive market conditions. 


“Although, it was expected that the company would partly deleverage by raising funds from the proposed asset monetization and sale of partial stake in Singer (keeping controlling stake with Hayleys), the same has been significantly delayed due to the subdued market conditions prevailing over the past two years,” the rating agency said. 


ICRA Lanka, a part of Moody’s Investors Service, last week affirmed Hayleys’ entity rating at A+ but revised down the outlook to ‘Negative’ from ‘Stable’ citing continued debt increase, particularly at the standalone level, leading to weakening of the capital structure during FY2020 and 1QFY21.

ICRA Lanka measured how the company’s gearing had evolved from 1.7 times on FY2018 to 2.0 times, 2.95 times and 3.0 times as of FY2019, FY2020 and 1QFY2021 respectively. 

However, the rating agency said the company’s liquidity risks are mitigated to a larger extent, “due to the company’s track record with financial institutions and easy access to capital markets, and access to undrawn sanctioned lines,” which supports the overall liquidity position. 


For the three months ended June 30, 2020, Hayleys PLC reported negative earnings of Rs.3.80 a share or a net loss of Rs.285.2 million compared to negative earnings of Rs.7.31 a share or a net loss of Rs.548.5 million in the comparable period last year, as losses in the leisure business and the finance cost at the group level weighed on the performance. 


The company had total debt stock of Rs.121.5 billion by end-June, nearly twice the equity amount, which was Rs.63.5 billion. ","Daily Mirror - Print Edition
